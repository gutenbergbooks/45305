<h3>TO SUBSCRIBERS.</h3>


<p>MESSRS. CLARK have much pleasure in publishing the first issue
of Translations of the Writings of <span class="smcap">St. Augustine</span>:</p>

<h3>THE 'CITY OF GOD,'</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Two Volumes</span>.</p>

<p>They believe this will prove not the least valuable of their various
Series, and no pains will be spared to make it so. The Editor has secured
a most competent staff of Translators, and every care is being taken to
secure not only accuracy but elegance.</p>

<p>The Works of <span class="smcap">St. Augustine</span> to be included in the Series are (in addition
to the '<span class="smcap">City of God</span>'):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-1em">

<p>All the <span class="smcap">Treatises</span> in the <span class="smcap">Pelagian</span>, and the four leading <span class="smcap">Treatises</span>
in the <span class="smcap">Donatist Controversy</span>.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Treatises</span> against <span class="smcap">Faustus</span> the Manich√¶an; on <span class="smcap">Christian
Doctrine</span>; the <span class="smcap">Trinity</span>; the <span class="smcap">Harmony of the Evangelists</span>; the
<span class="smcap">Sermon on the Mount</span>.</p>

<p>Also, the <span class="smcap">Lectures</span> on the <span class="smcap">Gospel of St. John</span>, the <span class="smcap">Confessions</span>, a
<span class="smcap">Selection</span> from the <span class="smcap">Letters</span>, the <span class="smcap">Retractations</span>, the <span class="smcap">Soliloquies</span>,
and <span class="smcap">Selections</span> from the <span class="smcap">Practical Treatises</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>All these works are of first-rate importance, and only a small proportion
of them have yet appeared in an English dress. The <span class="smcap">Sermons</span> and the
<span class="smcap">Commentaries on the Psalms</span> having been already given by the Oxford
Translators, it is not intended, at least in the first instance, to publish
them.</p>

<p>The Series will include a <span class="smcap">Life of St. Augustine</span>, by <span class="smcap">Robert Rainy</span>,
D.D., Professor of Church History, New College, Edinburgh.</p>

<p>The Series will probably extend to Sixteen or Eighteen Volumes. The
Publishers will be glad to receive the <i>Names</i> of Subscribers as early as
possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Subscription</span>: Four Volumes for a Guinea, <i>payable in advance</i>, as in the
case of the <span class="smcap">Ante-Nicene Series</span> (24s. when not paid in advance).</p>

<p>It is understood that Subscribers are bound to take at least the books of
the first two years. Each Volume will be sold separately at (on an
average) 10s. 6d. each volume.</p>

<p>The second issue will be ready in a few months, and will probably comprise:&mdash;The
Volume on the <span class="smcap">Donatist Controversy</span>, translated by the Rev.
<span class="smcap">J. R. King</span>, Vicar of St. Peter's in the East, Oxford; and the First
Volume of the <span class="smcap">Treatises</span> in the <span class="smcap">Pelagian Controversy</span>, translated by
Rev. <span class="smcap">Peter Holmes</span>, D.D., Rural Dean, etc., Plymouth.</p>

<p>They trust the Subscribers to the <span class="smcap">Ante-Nicene Library</span> will continue
their Subscription to this Series, and they hope to be favoured with an
early remittance of the Subscription.</p>

<h1>THE CITY OF GOD.</h1>


<h2>BOOK FOURTEENTH.[1]</h2>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>AUGUSTINE AGAIN TREATS OF THE SIN OF THE FIRST MAN, AND TEACHES THAT
IT IS THE CAUSE OF THE CARNAL LIFE AND VICIOUS AFFECTIONS OF MAN.
ESPECIALLY HE PROVES THAT THE SHAME WHICH ACCOMPANIES LUST IS THE
JUST PUNISHMENT OF THAT DISOBEDIENCE, AND INQUIRES HOW MAN, IF HE
HAD NOT SINNED, WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE WITHOUT LUST TO PROPAGATE
HIS KIND.</p></blockquote>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>1. <i>That the disobedience of the first man would have plunged all men into the
endless misery of the second death, had not the grace of God rescued many.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We have already stated in the preceding books that God,
desiring not only that the human race might be able
by their similarity of nature to associate with one another,
but also that they might be bound together in harmony and
peace by the ties of relationship, was pleased to derive all
men from one individual, and created man with such a
nature that the members of the race should not have died,
had not the two first (of whom the one was created out of
nothing, and the other out of him) merited this by their disobedience;
for by them so great a sin was committed, that by
it the human nature was altered for the worse, and was transmitted
also to their posterity, liable to sin and subject to
death. And the kingdom of death so reigned over men, that
the deserved penalty of sin would have hurled all headlong
even into the second death, of which there is no end, had not
the undeserved grace of God saved some therefrom. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
thus it has come to pass, that though there are very many
and great nations all over the earth, whose rites and customs,
speech, arms, and dress, are distinguished by marked differences,
yet there are no more than two kinds of human society,
which we may justly call two cities, according to the language
of our Scriptures. The one consists of those who wish to live
after the flesh, the other of those who wish to live after the
spirit; and when they severally achieve what they wish, they
live in peace, each after their kind.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of carnal life, which is to be understood not only of living in bodily indulgence,
but also of living in the vices of the inner man.</i></p>

<p>First, we must see what it is to live after the flesh, and what
to live after the spirit. For any one who either does not
recollect, or does not sufficiently weigh, the language of sacred
Scripture, may, on first hearing what we have said, suppose
that the Epicurean philosophers live after the flesh, because
they place man's highest good in bodily pleasure; and that
those others do so who have been of opinion that in some
form or other bodily good is man's supreme good; and that
the mass of men do so who, without dogmatizing or philosophizing
on the subject, are so prone to lust that they cannot
delight in any pleasure save such as they receive from bodily
sensations: and he may suppose that the Stoics, who place
the supreme good of men in the soul, live after the spirit; for
what is man's soul, if not spirit? But in the sense of the
divine Scripture both are proved to live after the flesh. For
by flesh it means not only the body of a terrestrial and mortal
animal, as when it says, "All flesh is not the same flesh,
but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of
beasts, another of fishes, another of birds,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> but it uses this
word in many other significations; and among these various
usages, a frequent one is to use flesh for man himself, the
nature of man taking the part for the whole, as in the words,
"By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified;"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
for what does he mean here by "no flesh" but "no man?"
And this, indeed, he shortly after says more plainly: "No man
shall be justified by the law;"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and in the Epistle to the
Galatians, "Knowing that a man is not justified by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
works of the law." And so we understand the words, "And
the Word was made flesh,"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;that is, man, which some not
accepting in its right sense, have supposed that Christ had not
a human soul.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> For as the whole is used for the part in the
words of Mary Magdalene in the Gospel, "They have taken
away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him,"<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
by which she meant only the flesh of Christ, which she supposed
had been taken from the tomb where it had been
buried, so the part is used for the whole, flesh being named,
while man is referred to, as in the quotations above cited.</p>

<p>Since, then, Scripture uses the word flesh in many ways,
which there is not time to collect and investigate, if we are to
ascertain what it is to live after the flesh (which is certainly
evil, though the nature of flesh is not itself evil), we must
carefully examine that passage of the epistle which the
Apostle Paul wrote to the Galatians, in which he says, "Now
the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these: adultery,
fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft,
hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of
the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time
past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the
kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> This whole passage of the apostolic
epistle being considered, so far as it bears on the matter in
hand, will be sufficient to answer the question, what it is to
live after the flesh. For among the works of the flesh which
he said were manifest, and which he cited for condemnation,
we find not only those which concern the pleasure of the
flesh, as fornications, uncleanness, lasciviousness, drunkenness,
revellings, but also those which, though they be remote from
fleshly pleasure, reveal the vices of the soul. For who does
not see that idolatries, witchcrafts, hatreds, variance, emulations,
wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, are vices rather of the
soul than of the flesh? For it is quite possible for a man to
abstain from fleshly pleasures for the sake of idolatry or some
heretical error; and yet, even when he does so, he is proved by
this apostolic authority to be living after the flesh; and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
abstaining from fleshly pleasure, he is proved to be practising
damnable works of the flesh. Who that has enmity has it
not in his soul? or who would say to his enemy, or to the
man he thinks his enemy, You have a bad flesh towards me,
and not rather, You have a bad spirit towards me? In fine,
if any one heard of what I may call "carnalities," he would
not fail to attribute them to the carnal part of man; so no
one doubts that "animosities" belong to the soul of man.
Why then does the doctor of the Gentiles in faith and verity
call all these and similar things works of the flesh, unless
because, by that mode of speech whereby the part is used for
the whole, he means us to understand by the word flesh the
man himself?</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap143"></a>3. <i>That sin is caused not by the flesh, but by the soul, and that the corruption
contracted from sin is not sin, but sin's punishment.</i></p>

<p>But if any one says that the flesh is the cause of all vices
and ill conduct, inasmuch as the soul lives wickedly only
because it is moved by the flesh, it is certain he has not
carefully considered the whole nature of man. For "the
corruptible body, indeed, weigheth down the soul."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Whence,
too, the apostle, speaking of this corruptible body, of which
he had shortly before said, "though our outward man perish,"<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
says, "We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle
were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made
with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan,
earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is
from heaven: if so be that being clothed we shall not be found
naked. For we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being
burdened: not for that we would be unclothed, but clothed
upon, that mortality might be swallowed up in life."<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> We
are then burdened with this corruptible body; but knowing
that the cause of this burdensomeness is not the nature and
substance of the body, but its corruption, we do not desire to
be deprived of the body, but to be clothed with its immortality.
For then, also, there will be a body, but it shall no
longer be a burden, being no longer corruptible. At present,
then, "the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the
earthly tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
many things," nevertheless they are in error who suppose that
all the evils of the soul proceed from the body.</p>

<p>Virgil, indeed, seems to express the sentiments of Plato in
the beautiful lines, where he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A fiery strength inspires their lives,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">An essence that from heaven derives,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Though clogged in part by limbs of clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the dull 'vesture of decay;'"<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>but though he goes on to mention the four most common
mental emotions,&mdash;desire, fear, joy, sorrow,&mdash;with the intention
of showing that the body is the origin of all sins and
vices, saying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And human laughter, human tears,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">They look abroad, yet see no light,"<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>yet we believe quite otherwise. For the corruption of the
body, which weighs down the soul, is not the cause but the
punishment of the first sin; and it was not the corruptible
flesh that made the soul sinful, but the sinful soul that made
the flesh corruptible. And though from this corruption of
the flesh there arise certain incitements to vice, and indeed
vicious desires, yet we must not attribute to the flesh all
the vices of a wicked life, in case we thereby clear the devil
of all these, for he has no flesh. For though we cannot call
the devil a fornicator or drunkard, or ascribe to him any
sensual indulgence (though he is the secret instigator and
prompter of those who sin in these ways), yet he is exceedingly
proud and envious. And this viciousness has so possessed
him, that on account of it he is reserved in chains of
darkness to everlasting punishment.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Now these vices, which
have dominion over the devil, the apostle attributes to the
flesh, which certainly the devil has not. For he says
"hatred, variance, emulations, strife, envying" are the works
of the flesh; and of all these evils pride is the origin and
head, and it rules in the devil though he has no flesh. For
who shows more hatred to the saints? who is more at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
variance with them? who more envious, bitter, and jealous?
And since he exhibits all these works, though he has no flesh,
how are they works of the flesh, unless because they are the
works of man, who is, as I said, spoken of under the name of
flesh? For it is not by having flesh, which the devil has not,
but by living according to himself,&mdash;that is, according to
man,&mdash;that man became like the devil. For the devil too,
wished to live according to himself when he did not abide in
the truth; so that when he lied, this was not of God, but of
himself, who is not only a liar, but the father of lies, he being
the first who lied, and the originator of lying as of sin.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>What it is to live according to man, and what to live according to God.</i></p>

<p>When, therefore, man lives according to man, not according
to God, he is like the devil. Because not even an angel
might live according to an angel, but only according to God,
if he was to abide in the truth, and speak God's truth and
not his own lie. And of man, too, the same apostle says in
another place, "If the truth of God hath more abounded
through my lie;"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>&mdash;"my lie," he said, and "God's truth."
When, then, a man lives according to the truth, he lives not
according to himself, but according to God; for He was
God who said, "I am the truth."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> When, therefore, man
lives according to himself,&mdash;that is, according to man, not
according to God,&mdash;assuredly he lives according to a lie; not
that man himself is a lie, for God is his author and creator,
who is certainly not the author and creator of a lie, but
because man was made upright, that he might not live according
to himself, but according to Him that made him,&mdash;in other
words, that he might do His will and not his own; and not to
live as he was made to live, that is a lie. For he certainly
desires to be blessed even by not living so that he may be
blessed. And what is a lie if this desire be not? Wherefore
it is not without meaning said that all sin is a lie. For
no sin is committed save by that desire or will by which we
desire that it be well with us, and shrink from it being ill
with us. That, therefore, is a lie which we do in order that
it may be well with us, but which makes us more miserable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
than we were. And why is this, but because the source of
man's happiness lies only in God, whom he abandons when
he sins, and not in himself, by living according to whom he
sins?</p>

<p>In enunciating this proposition of ours, then, that because
some live according to the flesh and others according to the
spirit there have arisen two diverse and conflicting cities,
we might equally well have said, "because some live according
to man, others according to God." For Paul says very
plainly to the Corinthians, "For whereas there is among you
envying and strife, are ye not carnal, and walk according to
man?"<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> So that to walk according to man and to be carnal
are the same; for by <i>flesh</i>, that is, by a part of man, man
is meant. For before he said that those same persons were
animal whom afterwards he calls carnal, saying, "For what
man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man
which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no
man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received not the
spirit of this world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we
might know the things which are freely given to us of God.
Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing
spiritual things with spiritual. But the animal man
perceiveth not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are
foolishness unto him."<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is to men of this kind, then, that
is, to animal men, he shortly after says, "And I, brethren, could
not speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
And this is to be interpreted by the same usage, a part being
taken for the whole. For both the soul and the flesh, the
component parts of man, can be used to signify the whole
man; and so the animal man and the carnal man are not two
different things, but one and the same thing, viz. man living
according to man. In the same way it is nothing else than
men that are meant either in the words, "By the deeds of
the law there shall no <i>flesh</i> be justified;"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> or in the words,
"Seventy-five <i>souls</i> went down into Egypt with Jacob."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> In
the one passage, "no flesh" signifies "no man;" and in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
other, by "seventy-five souls" seventy-five men are meant.
And the expression, "not in words which man's wisdom
teacheth," might equally be "not in words which fleshly
wisdom teacheth;" and the expression, "ye walk according to
man," might be "according to the flesh." And this is still
more apparent in the words which followed: "For while one
saith, I am of Paul, and another, I am of Apollos, are ye not
men?" The same thing which he had before expressed by
"ye are animal," "ye are carnal," he now expresses by "ye
are men;" that is, ye live according to man, not according to
God, for if you lived according to Him, you should be gods.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap145"></a>5. <i>That the opinion of the Platonists regarding the nature of body and soul is
not so censurable as that of the Manich√¶ans, but that even it is objectionable,
because it ascribes the origin of vices to the nature of the flesh.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There is no need, therefore, that in our sins and vices we
accuse the nature of the flesh to the injury of the Creator, for
in its own kind and degree the flesh is good; but to desert the
Creator good, and live according to the created good, is not good,
whether a man choose to live according to the flesh, or according
to the soul, or according to the whole human nature, which
is composed of flesh and soul, and which is therefore spoken of
either by the name flesh alone, or by the name soul alone. For
he who extols the nature of the soul as the chief good, and condemns
the nature of the flesh as if it were evil, assuredly is
fleshly both in his love of the soul and hatred of the flesh; for
these his feelings arise from human fancy, not from divine
truth. The Platonists, indeed, are not so foolish as, with the
Manich√¶ans, to detest our present bodies as an evil nature;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
for they attribute all the elements of which this visible and
tangible world is compacted, with all their qualities, to God
their Creator. Nevertheless, from the death-infected members
and earthly construction of the body they believe the soul is so
affected, that there are thus originated in it the diseases of
desires, and fears, and joy, and sorrow, under which four perturbations,
as Cicero<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> calls them, or passions, as most prefer
to name them with the Greeks, is included the whole viciousness
of human life. But if this be so, how is it that √Üneas
in Virgil, when he had heard from his father in Hades that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
the souls should return to bodies, expresses surprise at this
declaration, and exclaims:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O father! and can thought conceive<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That happy souls this realm would leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">And seek the upper sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With sluggish clay to reunite?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This direful longing for the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i12">Whence comes it, say, and why?"<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This direful longing, then, does it still exist even in that
boasted purity of the disembodied spirits, and does it still
proceed from the death-infected members and earthly limbs?
Does he not assert that, when they begin to long to return
to the body, they have already been delivered from all these
so-called pestilences of the body? From which we gather
that, were this endlessly alternating purification and defilement
of departing and returning souls as true as it is most certainly
false, yet it could not be averred that all culpable and vicious
motions of the soul originate in the earthly body; for, on their
own showing, "this direful longing," to use the words of their
noble exponent, is so extraneous to the body, that it moves
the soul that is purged of all bodily taint, and is existing
apart from any body whatever, and moves it, moreover, to be
embodied again. So that even they themselves acknowledge
that the soul is not only moved to desire, fear, joy, sorrow, by
the flesh, but that it can also be agitated with these emotions
at its own instance.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap146"></a>6. <i>Of the character of the human will which makes the affections of the soul
right or wrong.</i></p>

<p>But the character of the human will is of moment; because,
if it is wrong, these motions of the soul will be wrong, but if
it is right, they will be not merely blameless, but even praiseworthy.
For the will is in them all; yea, none of them is
anything else than will. For what are desire and joy but a
volition of consent to the things we wish? And what are
fear and sadness but a volition of aversion from the things
which we do not wish? But when consent takes the form of
seeking to possess the things we wish, this is called desire;
and when consent takes the form of enjoying the things we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
wish, this is called joy. In like manner, when we turn with
aversion from that which we do not wish to happen, this
volition is termed fear; and when we turn away from that
which has happened against our will, this act of will is called
sorrow. And generally in respect of all that we seek or shun, as
a man's will is attracted or repelled, so it is changed and turned
into these different affections. Wherefore the man who lives
according to God, and not according to man, ought to be a lover
of good, and therefore a hater of evil. And since no one is
evil by nature, but whoever is evil is evil by vice, he who
lives according to God ought to cherish towards evil men a
perfect hatred, so that he shall neither hate the man because
of his vice, nor love the vice because of the man, but hate
the vice and love the man. For the vice being cursed, all
that ought to be loved, and nothing that ought to be hated,
will remain.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>That the words love and regard</i> (amor <i>and</i> dilectio) <i>are in Scripture used
indifferently of good and evil affection.</i></p>

<p>He who resolves to love God, and to love his neighbour as
himself, not according to man but according to God, is on
account of this love said to be of a good will; and this is in
Scripture more commonly called charity, but it is also, even
in the same books, called love. For the apostle says that the
man to be elected as a ruler of the people must be a lover of
good.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> And when the Lord Himself had asked Peter, "Hast
thou a regard for me (<i>diligis</i>) more than these?" Peter replied,
"Lord, Thou knowest that I love (<i>amo</i>) Thee." And
again a second time the Lord asked not whether Peter loved
(<i>amaret</i>) Him, but whether he had a regard (<i>diligeret</i>) for Him,
and he again answered, "Lord, Thou knowest that I love (<i>amo</i>)
Thee." But on the third interrogation the Lord Himself no
longer says, "Hast thou a regard (<i>diligis</i>) for me," but "Lovest
thou (<i>amas</i>) me?" And then the evangelist adds, "Peter was
grieved because He said unto him the third time, Lovest thou
(<i>amas</i>) me?" though the Lord had not said three times but only
once, "Lovest thou (<i>amas</i>) me?" and twice "<i>Diligis me?</i>" from
which we gather that, even when the Lord said "<i>diligis</i>," He used
an equivalent for "<i>amas</i>." Peter, too, throughout used one word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
for the one thing, and the third time also replied, "Lord, Thou
knowest all things, Thou knowest that I love (<i>amo</i>) Thee."<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p>

<p>I have judged it right to mention this, because some are
of opinion that charity or regard (<i>dilectio</i>) is one thing, love
(<i>amor</i>) another. They say that <i>dilectio</i> is used of a good affection,
<i>amor</i> of an evil love. But it is very certain that even
secular literature knows no such distinction. However, it is
for the philosophers to determine whether and how they differ,
though their own writings sufficiently testify that they make
great account of love (<i>amor</i>) placed on good objects, and even
on God Himself. But we wished to show that the Scriptures
of our religion, whose authority we prefer to all writings whatsoever,
make no distinction between <i>amor</i>, <i>dilectio</i>, and <i>caritas</i>;
and we have already shown that <i>amor</i> is used in a good connection.
And if any one fancy that <i>amor</i> is no doubt used
both of good and bad loves, but that <i>dilectio</i> is reserved for
the good only, let him remember what the psalm says, "He
that loveth (<i>diligit</i>) iniquity hateth his own soul;"<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and the
words of the Apostle John, "If any man love (<i>diligere</i>) the
world, the love (<i>dilectio</i>) of the Father is not in him."<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Here
you have in one passage <i>dilectio</i> used both in a good and a bad
sense. And if any one demands an instance of <i>amor</i> being
used in a bad sense (for we have already shown its use in a
good sense), let him read the words, "For men shall be lovers
(<i>amantes</i>) of their own selves, lovers (<i>amatores</i>) of money."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The right will is, therefore, well-directed love, and the
wrong will is ill-directed love. Love, then, yearning to have
what is loved, is desire; and having and enjoying it, is joy;
fleeing what is opposed to it, it is fear; and feeling what is
opposed to it, when it has befallen it, it is sadness. Now
these motions are evil if the love is evil; good if the love is
good. What we assert let us prove from Scripture. The
apostle "desires to depart, and to be with Christ."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> And,
"My soul desired to long for Thy judgments;"<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> or if it is
more appropriate to say, "My soul longed to desire Thy judgments."
And, "The desire of wisdom bringeth to a kingdom."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
Yet there has always obtained the usage of understanding desire
and concupiscence in a bad sense if the object be not defined.
But joy is used in a good sense: "Be glad in the Lord, and
rejoice, ye righteous."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> And, "Thou hast put gladness in my
heart."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> And, "Thou wilt fill me with joy with Thy countenance."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
Fear is used in a good sense by the apostle when
he says, "Work out your salvation with fear and trembling."<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
And, "Be not high-minded, but fear."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> And, "I fear, lest by
any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtilty,
so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is
in Christ."<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But with respect to sadness, which Cicero prefers
to call sickness (<i>√¶gritudo</i>), and Virgil pain (<i>dolor</i>) (as he
says, "<i>Dolent gaudentque</i>"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>), but which I prefer to call sorrow,
because sickness and pain are more commonly used to express
bodily suffering,&mdash;with respect to this emotion, I say, the question
whether it can be used in a good sense is more difficult.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>8. <i>Of the three perturbations, which the Stoics admitted in the soul of the wise
man to the exclusion of grief or sadness, which the manly mind ought not
to experience.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Those emotions which the Greeks call &#949;&#8016;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#953;, and
which Cicero calls <i>constanti√¶</i>, the Stoics would restrict to
three; and, instead of three "perturbations" in the soul of
the wise man, they substituted severally, in place of desire,
will; in place of joy, contentment; and for fear, caution;
and as to sickness or pain, which we, to avoid ambiguity,
preferred to call sorrow, they denied that it could exist in the
mind of a wise man. Will, they say, seeks the good, for this
the wise man does. Contentment has its object in good that
is possessed, and this the wise man continually possesses.
Caution avoids evil, and this the wise man ought to avoid.
But sorrow arises from evil that has already happened; and
as they suppose that no evil can happen to the wise man,
there can be no representative of sorrow in his mind. According
to them, therefore, none but the wise man wills, is
contented, uses caution; and that the fool can do no more
than desire, rejoice, fear, be sad. The former three affections<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Cicero calls <i>constanti√¶</i>, the last four <i>perturbationes</i>. Many,
however, call these last <i>passions</i>; and, as I have said, the
Greeks call the former &#949;&#8016;&#960;&#945;&#952;&#949;&#8055;&#945;&#953;, and the latter &#960;&#8049;&#952;&#951;. And
when I made a careful examination of Scripture to find
whether this terminology was sanctioned by it, I came upon
this saying of the prophet: "There is no contentment to the
wicked, saith the Lord;"<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> as if the wicked might more properly
rejoice than be contented regarding evils, for contentment
is the property of the good and godly. I found also
that verse in the Gospel: "Whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, do ye even so unto them;"<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> which seems
to imply that evil or shameful things may be the object of
desire, but not of will. Indeed, some interpreters have added
"good things" to make the expression more in conformity
with customary usage, and have given this meaning, "Whatsoever
good deeds that ye would that men should do unto
you." For they thought that this would prevent any one
from wishing other men to provide him with unseemly, not to
say shameful, gratifications,&mdash;luxurious banquets, for example,&mdash;on
the supposition that if he returned the like to them he
would be fulfilling this precept. In the Greek Gospel, however,
from which the Latin is translated, "good" does not
occur, but only, "All things whatsoever ye would that men
should do unto you, do ye even so unto them," and, as I
believe, because "good" is already included in the word
"would;" for He does not say "desire."</p>

<p>Yet though we may sometimes avail ourselves of these
precise proprieties of language, we are not to be always
bridled by them; and when we read those writers against
whose authority it is unlawful to reclaim, we must accept
the meanings above mentioned in passages where a right
sense can be educed by no other interpretation, as in those
instances we adduced partly from the prophet, partly from
the Gospel. For who does not know that the wicked exult
with joy? Yet "there is no <i>contentment</i> for the wicked,
saith the Lord." And how so, unless because contentment,
when the word is used in its proper and distinctive significance,
means something different from joy? In like manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
who would deny that it were wrong to enjoin upon men that
whatever they desire others to do to them they should themselves
do to others, lest they should mutually please one
another by shameful and illicit pleasure? And yet the precept,
"Whatsoever ye <i>would</i> that men should do unto you, do
ye even so to them," is very wholesome and just. And how is
this, unless because the will is in this place used strictly, and
signifies that will which cannot have evil for its object? But
ordinary phraseology would not have allowed the saying, "Be
unwilling to make any manner of lie,"<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> had there not been
also an evil will, whose wickedness separates it from that
which the angels celebrated, "Peace on earth, of good will to
men."<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> For "good" is superfluous if there is no other
kind of will but good will. And why should the apostle have
mentioned it among the praises of charity as a great thing,
that "it rejoices not in iniquity," unless because wickedness
does so rejoice? For even with secular writers these words
are used indifferently. For Cicero, that most fertile of
orators, says, "I desire, conscript fathers, to be merciful."<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
And who would be so pedantic as to say that he should have
said "I will" rather than "I desire," because the word is used
in a good connection? Again, in Terence, the profligate
youth, burning with wild lust, says, "I will nothing else than
Philumena."<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> That this "will" was lust is sufficiently indicated
by the answer of his old servant which is there introduced:
"How much better were it to try and banish that love
from your heart, than to speak so as uselessly to inflame your
passion still more!" And that contentment was used by secular
writers in a bad sense, that verse of Virgil testifies, in which
he most succinctly comprehends these four perturbations,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hence they fear and desire, grieve and are content."<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The same author had also used the expression, "the evil
contentments of the mind."<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> So that good and bad men
alike will, are cautious, and contented; or, to say the same
thing in other words, good and bad men alike desire, fear,
rejoice, but the former in a good, the latter in a bad fashion,
according as the will is right or wrong. Sorrow itself, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
which the Stoics would not allow to be represented in the
mind of the wise man, is used in a good sense, and especially
in our writings. For the apostle praises the Corinthians
because they had a godly sorrow. But possibly some one
may say that the apostle congratulated them because they
were penitently sorry, and that such sorrow can exist only in
those who have sinned. For these are his words: "For I
perceive that the same epistle hath made you sorry, though
it were but for a season. Now I rejoice, not that ye were
made sorry, but that ye sorrowed to repentance; for ye were
made sorry after a godly manner, that ye might receive
damage by us in nothing. For godly sorrow worketh repentance
to salvation not to be repented of, but the sorrow of the
world worketh death. For, behold, this selfsame thing that
ye sorrowed after a godly sort, what carefulness it wrought in
you!"<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Consequently the Stoics may defend themselves by
replying,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> that sorrow is indeed useful for repentance of sin,
but that this can have no place in the mind of the wise man,
inasmuch as no sin attaches to him of which he could
sorrowfully repent, nor any other evil the endurance or experience
of which could make him sorrowful. For they say
that Alcibiades (if my memory does not deceive me), who
believed himself happy, shed tears when Socrates argued with
him, and demonstrated that he was miserable because he was
foolish. In his case, therefore, folly was the cause of this
useful and desirable sorrow, wherewith a man mourns that he
is what he ought not to be. But the Stoics maintain not
that the fool, but that the wise man, cannot be sorrowful.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Of the perturbations of the soul which appear as right affections in the
life of the righteous.</i></p>

<p>But so far as regards this question of mental perturbations,
we have answered these philosophers in the ninth book<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>
of this work, showing that it is rather a verbal than a real
dispute, and that they seek contention rather than truth.
Among ourselves, according to the sacred Scriptures and
sound doctrine, the citizens of the holy city of God, who live
according to God in the pilgrimage of this life, both fear and
desire, and grieve and rejoice. And because their love is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
rightly placed, all these affections of theirs are right. They
fear eternal punishment, they desire eternal life; they grieve
because they themselves groan within themselves, waiting for
the adoption, the redemption of their body;<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> they rejoice in
hope, because there "shall be brought to pass the saying that
is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> In like
manner they fear to sin, they desire to persevere; they grieve
in sin, they rejoice in good works. They fear to sin, because
they hear that "because iniquity shall abound, the love of
many shall wax cold."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> They desire to persevere, because
they hear that it is written, "He that endureth to the end
shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> They grieve for sin, hearing that "If we say
that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is
not in us."<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> They rejoice in good works, because they hear
that "the Lord loveth a cheerful giver."<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> In like manner,
according as they are strong or weak, they fear or desire to
be tempted, grieve or rejoice in temptation. They fear to be
tempted, because they hear the injunction, "If a man be overtaken
in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one
in the spirit of meekness; considering thyself, lest thou also
be tempted."<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> They desire to be tempted, because they hear
one of the heroes of the city of God saying, "Examine me,
O Lord, and tempt me: try my reins and my heart."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> They
grieve in temptations, because they see Peter weeping;<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> they
rejoice in temptations, because they hear James saying, "My
brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>And not only on their own account do they experience
these emotions, but also on account of those whose deliverance
they desire and whose perdition they fear, and whose
loss or salvation affects them with grief or with joy. For
if we who have come into the Church from among the Gentiles
may suitably instance that noble and mighty hero who
glories in his infirmities, the teacher (<i>doctor</i>) of the nations
in faith and truth, who also laboured more than all his fellow-apostles,
and instructed the tribes of God's people by his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
epistles, which edified not only those of his own time, but
all those who were to be gathered in,&mdash;that hero, I say, and
athlete of Christ, instructed by Him, anointed of His Spirit,
crucified with Him, glorious in Him, lawfully maintaining
a great conflict on the theatre of this world, and being
made a spectacle to angels and men,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and pressing onwards
for the prize of his high calling,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>&mdash;very joyfully do we with
the eyes of faith behold him rejoicing with them that rejoice,
and weeping with them that weep;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> though hampered
by fightings without and fears within;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> desiring to depart
and to be with Christ;<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> longing to see the Romans, that he
might have some fruit among them as among other Gentiles;<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
being jealous over the Corinthians, and fearing in that
jealousy lest their minds should be corrupted from the chastity
that is in Christ;<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> having great heaviness and continual
sorrow of heart for the Israelites,<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> because they, being ignorant
of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their
own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the
righteousness of God;<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and expressing not only his sorrow,
but bitter lamentation over some who had formally sinned
and had not repented of their uncleanness and fornications.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>If these emotions and affections, arising as they do from
the love of what is good and from a holy charity, are to
be called vices, then let us allow these emotions which are
truly vices to pass under the name of virtues. But since
these affections, when they are exercised in a becoming way,
follow the guidance of right reason, who will dare to say
that they are diseases or vicious passions? Wherefore even
the Lord Himself, when He condescended to lead a human
life in the form of a slave, had no sin whatever, and yet
exercised these emotions where He judged they should be
exercised. For as there was in Him a true human body and
a true human soul, so was there also a true human emotion.
When, therefore, we read in the Gospel that the hard-heartedness
of the Jews moved Him to sorrowful indignation,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
He said, "I am glad for your sakes, to the intent ye may
believe,"<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> that when about to raise Lazarus He even shed
tears,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> that He earnestly desired to eat the passover with
His disciples,<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> that as His passion drew near His soul was
sorrowful,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> these emotions are certainly not falsely ascribed
to Him. But as He became man when it pleased Him, so,
in the grace of His definite purpose, when it pleased Him He
experienced those emotions in His human soul.</p>

<p>But we must further make the admission, that even when
these affections are well regulated, and according to God's
will, they are peculiar to this life, not to that future life we
look for, and that often we yield to them against our will.
And thus sometimes we weep in spite of ourselves, being
carried beyond ourselves, not indeed by culpable desire, but
by praiseworthy charity. In us, therefore, these affections
arise from human infirmity; but it was not so with the Lord
Jesus, for even His infirmity was the consequence of His
power. But so long as we wear the infirmity of this life, we
are rather worse men than better if we have none of these
emotions at all. For the apostle vituperated and abominated
some who, as he said, were "without natural affection."<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
The sacred Psalmist also found fault with those of whom he
said, "I looked for some to lament with me, and there was
none."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> For to be quite free from pain while we are in this
place of misery is only purchased, as one of this world's
literati perceived and remarked,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> at the price of blunted sensibilities
both of mind and body. And therefore that which
the Greeks call &#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;, and what the Latins would call, if
their language would allow them, "impassibilitas," if it be
taken to mean an impassibility of spirit and not of body, or,
in other words, a freedom from those emotions which are contrary
to reason and disturb the mind, then it is obviously a
good and most desirable quality, but it is not one which is
attainable in this life. For the words of the apostle are the
confession, not of the common herd, but of the eminently
pious, just, and holy men: "If we say we have no sin, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> When there
shall be no sin in a man, then there shall be this &#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#945;.
At present it is enough if we live without crime; and he
who thinks he lives without sin puts aside not sin, but
pardon. And if that is to be called apathy, where the mind
is the subject of no emotion, then who would not consider
this insensibility to be worse than all vices? It may, indeed,
reasonably be maintained that the perfect blessedness we
hope for shall be free from all sting of fear or sadness; but
who that is not quite lost to truth would say that neither
love nor joy shall be experienced there? But if by apathy a
condition be meant in which no fear terrifies nor any pain
annoys, we must in this life renounce such a state if we
would live according to God's will, but may hope to enjoy
it in that blessedness which is promised as our eternal condition.</p>

<p>For that fear of which the Apostle John says, "There is
no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear, because
fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in
love,"<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>&mdash;that fear is not of the same kind as the Apostle
Paul felt lest the Corinthians should be seduced by the
subtlety of the serpent; for love is susceptible of this fear,
yea, love alone is capable of it. But the fear which is not in
love is of that kind of which Paul himself says, "For ye
have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear."<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> But
as for that "clean fear which endureth for ever,"<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> if it is to
exist in the world to come (and how else can it be said to
endure for ever?), it is not a fear deterring us from evil
which may happen, but preserving us in the good which
cannot be lost. For where the love of acquired good is
unchangeable, there certainly the fear that avoids evil is, if
I may say so, free from anxiety. For under the name of
"clean fear" David signifies that will by which we shall
necessarily shrink from sin, and guard against it, not with the
anxiety of weakness, which fears that we may strongly sin,
but with the tranquillity of perfect love. Or if no kind of
fear at all shall exist in that most imperturbable security of
perpetual and blissful delights, then the expression, "The fear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever," must be taken in the
same sense as that other, "The patience of the poor shall not
perish for ever."<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> For patience, which is necessary only
where ills are to be borne, shall not be eternal, but that which
patience leads us to will be eternal. So perhaps this "clean
fear" is said to endure for ever, because that to which fear
leads shall endure.</p>

<p>And since this is so,&mdash;since we must live a good life in
order to attain to a blessed life,&mdash;a good life has all these
affections right, a bad life has them wrong. But in the
blessed life eternal there will be love and joy, not only right,
but also assured; but fear and grief there will be none.
Whence it already appears in some sort what manner of persons
the citizens of the city of God must be in this their
pilgrimage, who live after the spirit, not after the flesh,&mdash;that
is to say, according to God, not according to man,&mdash;and what
manner of persons they shall be also in that immortality
whither they are journeying. And the city or society of the
wicked, who live not according to God, but according to man,
and who accept the doctrines of men or devils in the worship
of a false and contempt of the true divinity, is shaken with
those wicked emotions as by diseases and disturbances. And
if there be some of its citizens who seem to restrain and, as
it were, temper those passions, they are so elated with ungodly
pride, that their disease is as much greater as their
pain is less. And if some, with a vanity monstrous in proportion
to its rarity, have become enamoured of themselves
because they can be stimulated and excited by no emotion,
moved or bent by no affection, such persons rather lose all
humanity than obtain true tranquillity. For a thing is not
necessarily right because it is inflexible, nor healthy because
it is insensible.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Whether it is to be believed that our first parents in Paradise, before they
sinned, were free from all perturbation.</i></p>

<p>But it is a fair question, whether our first parent or first
parents (for there was a marriage of two), before they sinned,
experienced in their animal body such emotions as we shall
not experience in the spiritual body when sin has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
purged and finally abolished. For if they did, then how
were they blessed in that boasted place of bliss, Paradise?
For who that is affected by fear or grief can be called absolutely
blessed? And what could those persons fear or suffer
in such affluence of blessings, where neither death nor ill-health
was feared, and where nothing was wanting which a
good will could desire, and nothing present which could
interrupt man's mental or bodily enjoyment? Their love to
God was unclouded, and their mutual affection was that of
faithful and sincere marriage; and from this love flowed a
wonderful delight, because they always enjoyed what was
loved. Their avoidance of sin was tranquil; and, so long as
it was maintained, no other ill at all could invade them and
bring sorrow. Or did they perhaps desire to touch and eat
the forbidden fruit, yet feared to die; and thus both fear and
desire already, even in that blissful place, preyed upon those
first of mankind? Away with the thought that such could
be the case where there was no sin! And, indeed, this is
already sin, to desire those things which the law of God
forbids, and to abstain from them through fear of punishment,
not through love of righteousness. Away, I say, with
the thought, that before there was any sin, there should
already have been committed regarding that fruit the very
sin which our Lord warns us against regarding a woman:
"Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed
adultery with her already in his heart."<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> As happy,
then, as were these our first parents, who were agitated by no
mental perturbations, and annoyed by no bodily discomforts,
so happy should the whole human race have been, had they
not introduced that evil which they have transmitted to their
posterity, and had none of their descendants committed
iniquity worthy of damnation; but this original blessedness
continuing until, in virtue of that benediction which said,
"Increase and multiply,"<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> the number of the predestined
saints should have been completed, there would then have
been bestowed that higher felicity which is enjoyed by the
most blessed angels,&mdash;a blessedness in which there should
have been a secure assurance that no one would sin, and no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
one die; and so should the saints have lived, after no taste of
labour, pain, or death, as now they shall live in the resurrection,
after they have endured all these things.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of the fall of the first man, in whom nature was created good, and can be
restored only by its Author.</i></p>

<p>But because God foresaw all things, and was therefore not
ignorant that man also would fall, we ought to consider this
holy city in connection with what God foresaw and ordained,
and not according to our own ideas, which do not embrace
God's ordination. For man, by his sin, could not disturb the
divine counsel, nor compel God to change what He had
decreed; for God's foreknowledge had anticipated both,&mdash;that
is to say, both how evil the man whom He had created good
should become, and what good He Himself should even thus
derive from him. For though God is said to change His
determinations (so that in a tropical sense the Holy Scripture
says even that God repented<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>), this is said with reference to
man's expectation, or the order of natural causes, and not
with reference to that which the Almighty had foreknown
that He would do. Accordingly God, as it is written, made
man upright,<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> and consequently with a good will. For if
he had not had a good will, he could not have been upright.
The good will, then, is the work of God; for God created
him with it. But the first evil will, which preceded all man's
evil acts, was rather a kind of falling away from the work of
God to its own works than any positive work. And therefore
the acts resulting were evil, not having God, but the will
itself for their end; so that the will or the man himself, so
far as his will is bad, was as it were the evil tree bringing
forth evil fruit. Moreover, the bad will, though it be not in
harmony with, but opposed to nature, inasmuch as it is a vice
or blemish, yet it is true of it as of all vice, that it cannot
exist except in a nature, and only in a nature created out of
nothing, and not in that which the Creator has begotten of
Himself, as He begot the Word, by whom all things were
made. For though God formed man of the dust of the earth,
yet the earth itself, and every earthly material, is absolutely
created out of nothing; and man's soul, too, God created out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of nothing, and joined to the body, when He made man. But
evils are so thoroughly overcome by good, that though they
are permitted to exist, for the sake of demonstrating how the
most righteous foresight of God can make a good use even of
them, yet good can exist without evil, as in the true and
supreme God Himself, and as in every invisible and visible
celestial creature that exists above this murky atmosphere;
but evil cannot exist without good, because the natures in
which evil exists, in so far as they are natures, are good.
And evil is removed, not by removing any nature, or part of
a nature, which had been introduced by the evil, but by
healing and correcting that which had been vitiated and
depraved. The will, therefore, is then truly free, when it is
not the slave of vices and sins. Such was it given us by
God; and this being lost by its own fault, can only be restored
by Him who was able at first to give it. And therefore the
truth says, "If the Son shall make you free, ye shall be free
indeed;"<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> which is equivalent to saying, If the Son shall save
you, ye shall be saved indeed. For He is our Liberator,
inasmuch as He is our Saviour.</p>

<p>Man then lived with God for his rule in a paradise at once
physical and spiritual. For neither was it a paradise only
physical for the advantage of the body, and not also spiritual
for the advantage of the mind; nor was it only spiritual to
afford enjoyment to man by his internal sensations, and not
also physical to afford him enjoyment through his external
senses. But obviously it was both for both ends. But after
that proud and therefore envious angel (of whose fall I have
said as much as I was able in the eleventh and twelfth books
of this work, as well as that of his fellows, who, from being
God's angels, became his angels), preferring to rule with a
kind of pomp of empire rather than to be another's subject,
fell from the spiritual Paradise, and essaying to insinuate his
persuasive guile into the mind of man, whose unfallen condition
provoked him to envy now that himself was fallen, he
chose the serpent as his mouthpiece in that bodily Paradise
in which it and all the other earthly animals were living with
those two human beings, the man and his wife, subject to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
them, and harmless; and he chose the serpent because, being
slippery, and moving in tortuous windings, it was suitable for
his purpose. And this animal being subdued to his wicked
ends by the presence and superior force of his angelic nature,
he abused as his instrument, and first tried his deceit upon
the woman, making his assault upon the weaker part of that
human alliance, that he might gradually gain the whole, and
not supposing that the man would readily give ear to him, or
be deceived, but that he might yield to the error of the woman.
For as Aaron was not induced to agree with the people when
they blindly wished him to make an idol, and yet yielded to
constraint; and as it is not credible that Solomon was so blind
as to suppose that idols should be worshipped, but was drawn
over to such sacrilege by the blandishments of women; so we
cannot believe that Adam was deceived, and supposed the
devil's word to be truth, and therefore transgressed God's law,
but that he by the drawings of kindred yielded to the woman,
the husband to the wife, the one human being to the only
other human being. For not without significance did the
apostle say, "And Adam was not deceived, but the woman
being deceived was in the transgression;"<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> but he speaks
thus, because the woman accepted as true what the serpent
told her, but the man could not bear to be severed from his
only companion, even though this involved a partnership in
sin. He was not on this account less culpable, but sinned
with his eyes open. And so the apostle does not say, "He did
not sin," but "He was not deceived." For he shows that he
sinned when he says, "By one man sin entered into the
world,"<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and immediately after more distinctly, "In the likeness
of Adam's transgression." But he meant that those are
deceived who do not judge that which they do to be sin; but
he knew. Otherwise how were it true "Adam was not deceived?"
But having as yet no experience of the divine
severity, he was possibly deceived in so far as he thought his
sin venial. And consequently he was not deceived as the
woman was deceived, but he was deceived as to the judgment
which would be passed on his apology: "The woman
whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me, and I did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
eat."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> What need of saying more? Although they were
not both deceived by credulity, yet both were entangled in
the snares of the devil, and taken by sin.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Of the nature of man's first sin.</i></p>

<p>If any one finds a difficulty in understanding why other
sins do not alter human nature as it was altered by the transgression
of those first human beings, so that on account of it
this nature is subject to the great corruption we feel and see,
and to death, and is distracted and tossed with so many furious
and contending emotions, and is certainly far different from
what it was before sin, even though it were then lodged in an
animal body,&mdash;if, I say, any one is moved by this, he ought
not to think that that sin was a small and light one because
it was committed about food, and that not bad nor noxious,
except because it was forbidden; for in that spot of singular
felicity God could not have created and planted any evil thing.
But by the precept He gave, God commended obedience, which
is, in a sort, the mother and guardian of all the virtues in the
reasonable creature, which was so created that submission is
advantageous to it, while the fulfilment of its own will in
preference to the Creator's is destruction. And as this commandment
enjoining abstinence from one kind of food in the
midst of great abundance of other kinds was so easy to keep,&mdash;so
light a burden to the memory,&mdash;and, above all, found no resistance
to its observance in lust, which only afterwards sprung
up as the penal consequence of sin, the iniquity of violating
it was all the greater in proportion to the ease with which it
might have been kept.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>That in Adam's sin an evil will preceded the evil act.</i></p>

<p>Our first parents fell into open disobedience because already
they were secretly corrupted; for the evil act had never
been done had not an evil will preceded it. And what is the
origin of our evil will but pride? For "pride is the beginning
of sin."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> And what is pride but the craving for undue
exaltation? And this is undue exaltation, when the soul
abandons Him to whom it ought to cleave as its end, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
becomes a kind of end to itself. This happens when it becomes
its own satisfaction. And it does so when it falls
away from that unchangeable good which ought to satisfy it
more than itself. This falling away is spontaneous; for if
the will had remained stedfast in the love of that higher and
changeless good by which it was illumined to intelligence
and kindled into love, it would not have turned away to find
satisfaction in itself, and so become frigid and benighted;
the woman would not have believed the serpent spoke the
truth, nor would the man have preferred the request of his
wife to the command of God, nor have supposed that it was
a venial transgression to cleave to the partner of his life even
in a partnership of sin. The wicked deed, then,&mdash;that is to
say, the transgression of eating the forbidden fruit,&mdash;was committed
by persons who were already wicked. That "evil
fruit"<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> could be brought forth only by "a corrupt tree." But
that the tree was evil was not the result of nature; for certainly
it could become so only by the vice of the will, and
vice is contrary to nature. Now, nature could not have been
depraved by vice had it not been made out of nothing. Consequently,
that it is a nature, this is because it is made by
God; but that it falls away from Him, this is because it is
made out of nothing. But man did not so fall away<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> as to
become absolutely nothing; but being turned towards himself,
his being became more contracted than it was when he clave
to Him who supremely is. Accordingly, to exist in himself,
that is, to be his own satisfaction after abandoning God, is
not quite to become a nonentity, but to approximate to that.
And therefore the holy Scriptures designate the proud by another
name, "self-pleasers." For it is good to have the heart
lifted up, yet not to one's self, for this is proud, but to the
Lord, for this is obedient, and can be the act only of the
humble. There is, therefore, something in humility which,
strangely enough, exalts the heart, and something in pride
which debases it. This seems, indeed, to be contradictory,
that loftiness should debase and lowliness exalt. But pious
humility enables us to submit to what is above us; and
nothing is more exalted above us than God; and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
humility, by making us subject to God, exalts us. But pride,
being a defect of nature, by the very act of refusing subjection
and revolting from Him who is supreme, falls to a low condition;
and then comes to pass what is written: "Thou castedst
them down when they lifted up themselves."<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> For he does
not say, "when they had been lifted up," as if first they were
exalted, and then afterwards cast down; but "when they lifted
up themselves" even then they were cast down,&mdash;that is to say,
the very lifting up was already a fall. And therefore it is
that humility is specially recommended to the city of God as
it sojourns in this world, and is specially exhibited in the city
of God, and in the person of Christ its King; while the contrary
vice of pride, according to the testimony of the sacred
writings, specially rules his adversary the devil. And certainly
this is the great difference which distinguishes the two cities
of which we speak, the one being the society of the godly
men, the other of the ungodly, each associated with the angels
that adhere to their party, and the one guided and fashioned
by love of self, the other by love of God.</p>

<p>The devil, then, would not have ensnared man in the open
and manifest sin of doing what God had forbidden, had man
not already begun to live for himself. It was this that made
him listen with pleasure to the words, "Ye shall be as gods,"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
which they would much more readily have accomplished by
obediently adhering to their supreme and true end than by
proudly living to themselves. For created gods are gods not
by virtue of what is in themselves, but by a participation of
the true God. By craving to be more, man becomes less; and
by aspiring to be self-sufficing, he fell away from Him who
truly suffices him. Accordingly, this wicked desire which
prompts man to please himself as if he were himself light, and
which thus turns him away from that light by which, had he
followed it, he would himself have become light,&mdash;this wicked
desire, I say, already secretly existed in him, and the open
sin was but its consequence. For that is true which is
written, "Pride goeth before destruction, and before honour
is humility;"<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> that is to say, secret ruin precedes open ruin,
while the former is not counted ruin. For who counts exaltation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
ruin, though no sooner is the Highest forsaken than a
fall is begun? But who does not recognise it as ruin, when
there occurs an evident and indubitable transgression of the
commandment? And consequently, God's prohibition had
reference to such an act as, when committed, could not be
defended on any pretence of doing what was righteous.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> And
I make bold to say that it is useful for the proud to fall into
an open and indisputable transgression, and so displease themselves,
as already, by pleasing themselves, they had fallen.
For Peter was in a healthier condition when he wept and was
dissatisfied with himself, than when he boldly presumed and
satisfied himself. And this is averred by the sacred Psalmist
when he says, "Fill their faces with shame, that they may
seek Thy name, O Lord;"<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> that is, that they who have pleased
themselves in seeking their own glory may be pleased and
satisfied with Thee in seeking Thy glory.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the pride in the sin, which was worse than the sin itself.</i></p>

<p>But it is a worse and more damnable pride which casts
about for the shelter of an excuse even in manifest sins, as
these our first parents did, of whom the woman said, "The
serpent beguiled me, and I did eat;" and the man said, "The
woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the
tree, and I did eat."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Here there is no word of begging
pardon, no word of entreaty for healing. For though they
do not, like Cain, deny that they have perpetrated the deed,
yet their pride seeks to refer its wickedness to another,&mdash;the
woman's pride to the serpent, the man's to the woman. But
where there is a plain transgression of a divine commandment,
this is rather to accuse than to excuse oneself. For
the fact that the woman sinned on the serpent's persuasion,
and the man at the woman's offer, did not make the transgression
less, as if there were any one whom we ought rather
to believe or yield to than God.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Of the justice of the punishment with which our first parents were visited for
their disobedience.</i></p>

<p>Therefore, because the sin was a despising of the authority<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
of God,&mdash;who had created man; who had made him in His own
image; who had set him above the other animals; who had
placed him in Paradise; who had enriched him with abundance
of every kind and of safety; who had laid upon him neither
many, nor great, nor difficult commandments, but, in order to
make a wholesome obedience easy to him, had given him a
single very brief and very light precept by which He reminded
that creature whose service was to be free that He was Lord,&mdash;it
was just that condemnation followed, and condemnation
such that man, who by keeping the commandments should
have been spiritual even in his flesh, became fleshly even in
his spirit; and as in his pride he had sought to be his own
satisfaction, God in His justice abandoned him to himself,
not to live in the absolute independence he affected, but
instead of the liberty he desired, to live dissatisfied with himself
in a hard and miserable bondage to him to whom by
sinning he had yielded himself, doomed in spite of himself
to die in body as he had willingly become dead in spirit,
condemned even to eternal death (had not the grace of God
delivered him) because he had forsaken eternal life. Whoever
thinks such punishment either excessive or unjust shows
his inability to measure the great iniquity of sinning where
sin might so easily have been avoided. For as Abraham's
obedience is with justice pronounced to be great, because the
thing commanded, to kill his son, was very difficult, so in
Paradise the disobedience was the greater, because the difficulty
of that which was commanded was imperceptible.
And as the obedience of the second Man was the more
laudable because He became obedient even "unto death,"<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> so
the disobedience of the first man was the more detestable
because he became disobedient even unto death. For where
the penalty annexed to disobedience is great, and the thing
commanded by the Creator is easy, who can sufficiently estimate
how great a wickedness it is, in a matter so easy, not to
obey the authority of so great a power, even when that power
deters with so terrible a penalty?</p>

<p>In short, to say all in a word, what but disobedience was
the punishment of disobedience in that sin? For what else<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
is man's misery but his own disobedience to himself, so that
in consequence of his not being willing to do what he could
do, he now wills to do what he cannot? For though he
could not do all things in Paradise before he sinned, yet he
wished to do only what he could do, and therefore he could
do all things he wished. But now, as we recognise in his
offspring, and as divine Scripture testifies, "Man is like to
vanity."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> For who can count how many things he wishes
which he cannot do, so long as he is disobedient to himself,
that is, so long as his mind and his flesh do not obey his
will? For in spite of himself his mind is both frequently
disturbed, and his flesh suffers, and grows old, and dies; and
in spite of ourselves we suffer whatever else we suffer, and
which we would not suffer if our nature absolutely and in all
its parts obeyed our will. But is it not the infirmities of the
flesh which hamper it in its service? Yet what does it
matter <i>how</i> its service is hampered, so long as the fact remains,
that by the just retribution of the sovereign God whom we
refused to be subject to and serve, our flesh, which was subjected
to us, now torments us by insubordination, although
our disobedience brought trouble on ourselves, not upon God?
For He is not in need of our service as we of our body's;
and therefore what we did was no punishment to Him, but
what we receive is so to us. And the pains which are called
bodily are pains of the soul in and from the body. For what
pain or desire can the flesh feel by itself and without the
soul? But when the flesh is said to desire or to suffer, it is
meant, as we have explained, that the man does so, or some
part of the soul which is affected by the sensation of the
flesh, whether a harsh sensation causing pain, or gentle, causing
pleasure. But pain in the flesh is only a discomfort of the
soul arising from the flesh, and a kind of shrinking from its
suffering, as the pain of the soul which is called sadness is a
shrinking from those things which have happened to us in
spite of ourselves. But sadness is frequently preceded by
fear, which is itself in the soul, not in the flesh; while bodily
pain is not preceded by any kind of fear of the flesh, which
can be felt in the flesh before the pain. But pleasure is preceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
by a certain appetite which is felt in the flesh like a
craving, as hunger and thirst and that generative appetite
which is most commonly identified with the name "lust,"
though this is the generic word for all desires. For anger
itself was defined by the ancients as nothing else than the
lust of revenge;<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> although sometimes a man is angry even at
inanimate objects which cannot feel his vengeance, as when
one breaks a pen, or crushes a quill that writes badly. Yet
even this, though less reasonable, is in its way a lust of
revenge, and is, so to speak, a mysterious kind of shadow of
[the great law of] retribution, that they who do evil should
suffer evil. There is therefore a lust for revenge, which is
called anger; there is a lust of money, which goes by the
name of avarice; there is a lust of conquering, no matter by
what means, which is called opinionativeness; there is a lust
of applause, which is named boasting. There are many and
various lusts, of which some have names of their own, while
others have not. For who could readily give a name to the
lust of ruling, which yet has a powerful influence in the
soul of tyrants, as civil wars bear witness?</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of the evil of lust,&mdash;a word which, though applicable to many vices, is
specially appropriated to sexual uncleanness.</i></p>

<p>Although, therefore, lust may have many objects, yet when
no object is specified, the word lust usually suggests to the
mind the lustful excitement of the organs of generation.
And this lust not only takes possession of the whole body
and outward members, but also makes itself felt within, and
moves the whole man with a passion in which mental emotion
is mingled with bodily appetite, so that the pleasure which
results is the greatest of all bodily pleasures. So possessing
indeed is this pleasure, that at the moment of time in which
it is consummated, all mental activity is suspended. What
friend of wisdom and holy joys, who, being married, but
knowing, as the apostle says, "how to possess his vessel in
sanctification and honour, not in the disease of desire, as the
Gentiles who know not God,"<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> would not prefer, if this were
possible, to beget children without this lust, so that in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
function of begetting offspring the members created for this
purpose should not be stimulated by the heat of lust, but
should be actuated by his volition, in the same way as his
other members serve him for their respective ends? But
even those who delight in this pleasure are not moved to it
at their own will, whether they confine themselves to lawful
or transgress to unlawful pleasures; but sometimes this lust
importunes them in spite of themselves, and sometimes fails
them when they desire to feel it, so that though lust rages in
the mind, it stirs not in the body. Thus, strangely enough,
this emotion not only fails to obey the legitimate desire to
beget offspring, but also refuses to serve lascivious lust; and
though it often opposes its whole combined energy to the
soul that resists it, sometimes also it is divided against itself,
and while it moves the soul, leaves the body unmoved.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of the nakedness of our first parents, which they saw after their base and
shameful sin.</i></p>

<p>Justly is shame very specially connected with this lust;
justly, too, these members themselves, being moved and
restrained not at our will, but by a certain independent
autocracy, so to speak, are called "shameful." Their condition
was different before sin. For as it is written, "They
were naked and were not ashamed,"<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>&mdash;not that their nakedness
was unknown to them, but because nakedness was not
yet shameful, because not yet did lust move those members
without the will's consent; not yet did the flesh by its disobedience
testify against the disobedience of man. For they
were not created blind, as the unenlightened vulgar fancy;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
for Adam saw the animals to whom he gave names, and of Eve
we read, "The woman saw that the tree was good for food, and
that it was pleasant to the eyes."<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Their eyes, therefore, were
open, but were not open to this, that is to say, were not
observant so as to recognise what was conferred upon them
by the garment of grace, for they had no consciousness of
their members warring against their will. But when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
were stripped of this grace,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> that their disobedience might be
punished by fit retribution, there began in the movement of
their bodily members a shameless novelty which made nakedness
indecent: it at once made them observant and made
them ashamed. And therefore, after they violated God's
command by open transgression, it is written: "And the eyes
of them both were opened, and they knew that they were
naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves
aprons."<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> "The eyes of them both were opened," not
to see, for already they saw, but to discern between the good
they had lost and the evil into which they had fallen. And
therefore also the tree itself which they were forbidden to
touch was called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
from this circumstance, that if they ate of it it would impart
to them this knowledge. For the discomfort of sickness
reveals the pleasure of health. "They knew," therefore,
"that they were naked,"&mdash;naked of that grace which prevented
them from being ashamed of bodily nakedness while
the law of sin offered no resistance to their mind. And thus
they obtained a knowledge which they would have lived in
blissful ignorance of, had they, in trustful obedience to God,
declined to commit that offence which involved them in the
experience of the hurtful effects of unfaithfulness and disobedience.
And therefore, being ashamed of the disobedience
of their own flesh, which witnessed to their disobedience
while it punished it, "they sewed fig leaves together, and
made themselves aprons," that is, cinctures for their privy
parts; for some interpreters have rendered the word by
<i>succinctoria</i>. <i>Campestria</i> is, indeed, a Latin word, but it
is used of the drawers or aprons used for a similar purpose
by the young men who stripped for exercise in the <i>campus</i>;
hence those who were so girt were commonly called <i>campestrati</i>.
Shame modestly covered that which lust disobediently
moved in opposition to the will which was thus punished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
for its own disobedience. Consequently all nations, being
propagated from that one stock, have so strong an instinct to
cover the shameful parts, that some barbarians do not uncover
them even in the bath, but wash with their drawers
on. In the dark solitudes of India also, though some philosophers
go naked, and are therefore called gymnosophists,
yet they make an exception in the case of these members,
and cover them.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of the shame which attends all sexual intercourse.</i></p>

<p>Lust requires for its consummation darkness and secrecy;
and this not only when unlawful intercourse is desired, but
even such fornication as the earthly city has legalized.
Where there is no fear of punishment, these permitted
pleasures still shrink from the public eye. Even where provision
is made for this lust, secrecy also is provided; and while
lust found it easy to remove the prohibitions of law, shamelessness
found it impossible to lay aside the veil of retirement. For
even shameless men call this shameful; and though they love
the pleasure, dare not display it. What! does not even conjugal
intercourse, sanctioned as it is by law for the propagation
of children, legitimate and honourable though it be, does
it not seek retirement from every eye? Before the bridegroom
fondles his bride, does he not exclude the attendants, and even
the paranymphs, and such friends as the closest ties have
admitted to the bridal chamber? The greatest master of
Roman eloquence says, that all right actions wish to be set in
the light, <i>i.e.</i> desire to be known. This right action, however,
has such a desire to be known, that yet it blushes to be seen.
Who does not know what passes between husband and wife
that children may be born? Is it not for this purpose that
wives are married with such ceremony? And yet, when this
well-understood act is gone about for the procreation of children,
not even the children themselves, who may already have
been born to them, are suffered to be witnesses. This right
action seeks the light, in so far as it seeks to be known, but
yet dreads being seen. And why so, if not because that
which is by nature fitting and decent is so done as to be
accompanied with a shame-begetting penalty of sin?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">19. <i>That it is now necessary, as it was not before man sinned, to bridle anger
and lust by the restraining influence of wisdom.</i></p>

<p>Hence it is that even the philosophers who have approximated
to the truth have avowed that anger and lust are vicious
mental emotions, because, even when exercised towards objects
which wisdom does not prohibit, they are moved in an ungoverned
and inordinate manner, and consequently need the
regulation of mind and reason. And they assert that this third
part of the mind is posted as it were in a kind of citadel, to give
rule to these other parts, so that, while it rules and they serve,
man's righteousness is preserved without a breach.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> These
parts, then, which they acknowledge to be vicious even in a
wise and temperate man, so that the mind, by its composing
and restraining influence, must bridle and recall them from
those objects towards which they are unlawfully moved, and
give them access to those which the law of wisdom sanctions,&mdash;that
anger, <i>e.g.</i>, may be allowed for the enforcement of a just
authority, and lust for the duty of propagating offspring,&mdash;these
parts, I say, were not vicious in Paradise before sin,
for they were never moved in opposition to a holy will towards
any object from which it was necessary that they should be
withheld by the restraining bridle of reason. For though
now they are moved in this way, and are regulated by a
bridling and restraining power, which those who live temperately,
justly, and godly exercise, sometimes with ease, and
sometimes with greater difficulty, this is not the sound health
of nature, but the weakness which results from sin. And how
is it that shame does not hide the acts and words dictated by
anger or other emotions, as it covers the motions of lust,
unless because the members of the body which we employ for
accomplishing them are moved, not by the emotions themselves,
but by the authority of the consenting will? For he
who in his anger rails at or even strikes some one, could not
do so were not his tongue and hand moved by the authority
of the will, as also they are moved when there is no anger.
But the organs of generation are so subjected to the rule of
lust, that they have no motion but what it communicates.
It is this we are ashamed of; it is this which blushingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
hides from the eyes of onlookers. And rather will a man
endure a crowd of witnesses when he is unjustly venting his
anger on some one, than the eye of one man when he innocently
copulates with his wife.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the foolish beastliness of the Cynics.</i></p>

<p>It is this which those canine or cynic<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> philosophers have
overlooked, when they have, in violation of the modest instincts
of men, boastfully proclaimed their unclean and shameless
opinion, worthy indeed of dogs, viz., that as the matrimonial
act is legitimate, no one should be ashamed to perform it
openly, in the street or in any public place. Instinctive
shame has overborne this wild fancy. For though it is related<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
that Diogenes once dared to put his opinion in practice, under
the impression that his sect would be all the more famous if
his egregious shamelessness were deeply graven in the memory
of mankind, yet this example was not afterwards followed.
Shame had more influence with them, to make them blush
before men, than error to make them affect a resemblance to
dogs. And possibly, even in the case of Diogenes, and those
who did imitate him, there was but an appearance and pretence
of copulation, and not the reality. Even at this day
there are still Cynic philosophers to be seen; for these are
Cynics who are not content with being clad in the <i>pallium</i>,
but also carry a club; yet no one of them dares to do this
that we speak of. If they did, they would be spat upon, not
to say stoned, by the mob. Human nature, then, is without
doubt ashamed of this lust; and justly so, for the insubordination
of these members, and their defiance of the will, are the
clear testimony of the punishment of man's first sin. And it
was fitting that this should appear specially in those parts
by which is generated that nature which has been altered for
the worse by that first and great sin,&mdash;that sin from whose evil
connection no one can escape, unless God's grace expiate in

<p class="center">21. <i>That man's transgression did not annul the blessing of fecundity pronounced
upon man before he sinned, but infected it with the disease of lust.</i></p>

<p>Far be it, then, from us to suppose that our first parents in
Paradise felt that lust which caused them afterwards to blush
and hide their nakedness, or that by its means they should
have fulfilled the benediction of God, "Increase and multiply
and replenish the earth;"<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> for it was after sin that lust
began. It was after sin that our nature, having lost the power
it had over the whole body, but not having lost all shame,
perceived, noticed, blushed at, and covered it. But that
blessing upon marriage, which encouraged them to increase
and multiply and replenish the earth, though, it continued
even after they had sinned, was yet given before they sinned,
in order that the procreation of children might be recognised
as part of the glory of marriage, and not of the punishment of
sin. But now, men being ignorant of the blessedness of Paradise,
suppose that children could not have been begotten there
in any other way than they know them to be begotten now,
<i>i.e.</i> by lust, at which even honourable marriage blushes; some
not simply rejecting, but sceptically deriding the divine Scriptures,
in which we read that our first parents, after they sinned,
were ashamed of their nakedness, and covered it; while others,
though they accept and honour Scripture, yet conceive that
this expression, "Increase and multiply," refers not to carnal
fecundity, because a similar expression is used of the soul in
the words, "Thou wilt multiply me with strength in my
soul;"<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> and so, too, in the words which follow in Genesis,
"And replenish the earth, and subdue it," they understand by
the earth the body which the soul fills with its presence, and
which it rules over when it is multiplied in strength. And
they hold that children could no more then than now be
begotten without lust, which, after sin, was kindled, observed,
blushed for, and covered; and even that children would not
have been born in Paradise, but only outside of it, as in fact
it turned out. For it was after they were expelled from it
that they came together to beget children, and begot them.</p>

<p class="center">22. <i>Of the conjugal union as it was originally instituted and blessed by God.</i></p>

<p>But we, for our part, have no manner of doubt that to increase
and multiply and replenish the earth in virtue of the
blessing of God, is a gift of marriage as God instituted it
from the beginning before man sinned, when He created them
male and female,&mdash;in other words, two sexes manifestly distinct.
And it was this work of God on which His blessing
was pronounced. For no sooner had Scripture said, "Male
and female created He them,"<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> than it immediately continues,
"And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Increase,
and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it," etc.
And though all these things may not unsuitably be interpreted
in a spiritual sense, yet "male and female" cannot be
understood of two things in one man, as if there were in him
one thing which rules, another which is ruled; but it is quite
clear that they were created male and female, with bodies of
different sexes, for the very purpose of begetting offspring, and
so increasing, multiplying, and replenishing the earth; and it
is great folly to oppose so plain a fact. It was not of the
spirit which commands and the body which obeys, nor of the
rational soul which rules and the irrational desire which is
ruled, nor of the contemplative virtue which is supreme and
the active which is subject, nor of the understanding of the
mind and the sense of the body, but plainly of the matrimonial
union by which the sexes are mutually bound together,
that our Lord, when asked whether it were lawful for any
cause to put away one's wife (for on account of the hardness
of the hearts of the Israelites Moses permitted a bill of
divorcement to be given), answered and said, "Have ye not
read that He which made them at the beginning made them
male and female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave
father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they
twain shall be one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain,
but one flesh. What, therefore, God hath joined together, let
not man put asunder."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> It is certain, then, that from the
first men were created, as we see and know them to be now,
of two sexes, male and female, and that they are called one,
either on account of the matrimonial union, or on account of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
the origin of the woman, who was created from the side of the
man. And it is by this original example, which God Himself
instituted, that the apostle admonishes all husbands to love
their own wives in particular.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>23. <i>Whether generation should have taken place even in Paradise had man not
sinned, or whether there should have been any contention there between
chastity and lust.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But he who says that there should have been neither copulation
nor generation but for sin, virtually says that man's
sin was necessary to complete the number of the saints. For
if these two by not sinning should have continued to live
alone, because, as is supposed, they could not have begotten
children had they not sinned, then certainly sin was necessary
in order that there might be not only two but many righteous
men. And if this cannot be maintained without absurdity,
we must rather believe that the number of the saints fit to
complete this most blessed city would have been as great
though no one had sinned, as it is now that the grace of God
gathers its citizens out of the multitude of sinners, so long as
the children of this world generate and are generated.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>And therefore that marriage, worthy of the happiness of
Paradise, should have had desirable fruit without the shame
of lust, had there been no sin. But how that could be, there
is now no example to teach us. Nevertheless, it ought not to
seem incredible that one member might serve the will without
lust then, since so many serve it now. Do we now move our
feet and hands when we will to do the things we would by
means of these members? do we meet with no resistance in
them, but perceive that they are ready servants of the will,
both in our own case and in that of others, and especially of
artisans employed in mechanical operations, by which the
weakness and clumsiness of nature become, through industrious
exercise, wonderfully dexterous? and shall we not believe
that, like as all those members obediently serve the will, so
also should the members have discharged the function of
generation, though lust, the award of disobedience, had been
awanting? Did not Cicero, in discussing the difference of
governments in his <i>De Republica</i>, adopt a simile from human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
nature, and say that we command our bodily members as
children, they are so obedient; but that the vicious parts of
the soul must be treated as slaves, and be coerced with a more
stringent authority? And no doubt, in the order of nature,
the soul is more excellent than the body; and yet the soul
commands the body more easily than itself. Nevertheless
this lust, of which we at present speak, is the more shameful
on this account, because the soul is therein neither master of
itself, so as not to lust at all, nor of the body, so as to keep
the members under the control of the will; for if they were
thus ruled, there should be no shame. But now the soul is
ashamed that the body, which by nature is inferior and subject
to it, should resist its authority. For in the resistance
experienced by the soul in the other emotions there is less
shame, because the resistance is from itself, and thus, when it
is conquered by itself, itself is the conqueror, although the
conquest is inordinate and vicious, because accomplished by
those parts of the soul which ought to be subject to reason,
yet, being accomplished by its own parts and energies, the
conquest is, as I say, its own. For when the soul conquers
itself to a due subordination, so that its unreasonable motions
are controlled by reason, while it again is subject to God, this
is a conquest virtuous and praiseworthy. Yet there is less
shame when the soul is resisted by its own vicious parts than
when its will and order are resisted by the body, which is
distinct from and inferior to it, and dependent on it for life
itself.</p>

<p>But so long as the will retains under its authority the other
members, without which the members excited by lust to resist
the will cannot accomplish what they seek, chastity is preserved,
and the delight of sin foregone. And certainly, had
not culpable disobedience been visited with penal disobedience,
the marriage of Paradise should have been ignorant of this
struggle and rebellion, this quarrel between will and lust, that
the will may be satisfied and lust restrained, but those members,
like all the rest, should have obeyed the will. The field
of generation<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> should have been sown by the organ created
for this purpose, as the earth is sown by the hand. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
whereas now, as we essay to investigate this subject more
exactly, modesty hinders us, and compels us to ask pardon of
chaste ears, there would have been no cause to do so, but we
could have discoursed freely, and without fear of seeming
obscene, upon all those points which occur to one who meditates
on the subject. There would not have been even words
which could be called obscene, but all that might be said of
these members would have been as pure as what is said of
the other parts of the body. Whoever, then, comes to the
perusal of these pages with unchaste mind, let him blame his
disposition, not his nature; let him brand the actings of his
own impurity, not the words which necessity forces us to use,
and for which every pure and pious reader or hearer will very
readily pardon me, while I expose the folly of that scepticism
which argues solely on the ground of its own experience, and
has no faith in anything beyond. He who is not scandalized
at the apostle's censure of the horrible wickedness of the women
who "changed the natural use into that which is against
nature,"<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> will read all this without being shocked, especially
as we are not, like Paul, citing and censuring a damnable uncleanness,
but are explaining, so far as we can, human generation,
while with Paul we avoid all obscenity of language.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>24. <i>That if men had remained innocent and obedient in Paradise, the generative
organs should have been in subjection to the will as the other members are.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The man, then, would have sown the seed, and the woman
received it, as need required, the generative organs being
moved by the will, not excited by lust. For we move at
will not only those members which are furnished with joints
of solid bone, as the hands, feet, and fingers, but we move also
at will those which are composed of slack and soft nerves: we
can put them in motion, or stretch them out, or bend and
twist them, or contract and stiffen them, as we do with the
muscles of the mouth and face. The lungs, which are the
very tenderest of the viscera except the brain, and are therefore
carefully sheltered in the cavity of the chest, yet for all
purposes of inhaling and exhaling the breath, and of uttering
and modulating the voice, are obedient to the will when we
breathe, exhale, speak, shout, or sing, just as the bellows obey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the smith or the organist. I will not press the fact that some
animals have a natural power to move a single spot of the
skin with which their whole body is covered, if they have felt
on it anything they wish to drive off,&mdash;a power so great, that
by this shivering tremor of the skin they can not only shake
off flies that have settled on them, but even spears that have
fixed in their flesh. Man, it is true, has not this power; but
is this any reason for supposing that God could not give it to
such creatures as He wished to possess it? And therefore
man himself also might very well have enjoyed absolute
power over his members had he not forfeited it by his disobedience;
for it was not difficult for God to form him so
that what is now moved in his body only by lust should have
been moved only at will.</p>

<p>We know, too, that some men are differently constituted
from others, and have some rare and remarkable faculty of
doing with their body what other men can by no effort do,
and, indeed, scarcely believe when they hear of others doing.
There are persons who can move their ears, either one at a
time, or both together. There are some who, without moving
the head, can bring the hair down upon the forehead, and
move the whole scalp backwards and forwards at pleasure.
Some, by lightly pressing their stomach, bring up an incredible
quantity and variety of things they have swallowed, and produce
whatever they please, quite whole, as if out of a bag.
Some so accurately mimic the voices of birds and beasts and
other men, that, unless they are seen, the difference cannot be
told. Some have such command of their bowels, that they
can break wind continuously at pleasure, so as to produce
the effect of singing. I myself have known a man who was
accustomed to sweat whenever he wished. It is well known
that some weep when they please, and shed a flood of tears.
But far more incredible is that which some of our brethren
saw quite recently. There was a presbyter called Restitutus,
in the parish of the Calamensian<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Church, who, as often as he
pleased (and he was asked to do this by those who desired to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
witness so remarkable a phenomenon), on some one imitating
the wailings of mourners, became so insensible, and lay in a
state so like death, that not only had he no feeling when they
pinched and pricked him, but even when fire was applied to
him, and he was burned by it, he had no sense of pain except
afterwards from the wound. And that his body remained
motionless, not by reason of his self-command, but because
he was insensible, was proved by the fact that he breathed
no more than a dead man; and yet he said that, when any one
spoke with more than ordinary distinctness, he heard the voice,
but as if it were a long way off. Seeing, then, that even in
this mortal and miserable life the body serves some men by
many remarkable movements and moods beyond the ordinary
course of nature, what reason is there for doubting that, before
man was involved by his sin in this weak and corruptible
condition, his members might have served his will for the
propagation of offspring without lust? Man has been given
over to himself because he abandoned God, while he sought
to be self-satisfying; and disobeying God, he could not obey
even himself. Hence it is that he is involved in the obvious
misery of being unable to live as he wishes. For if he lived
as he wished, he would think himself blessed; but he could
not be so if he lived wickedly.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Of true blessedness, which this present life cannot enjoy.</i></p>

<p>However, if we look at this a little more closely, we see
that no one lives as he wishes but the blessed, and that no
one is blessed but the righteous. But even the righteous
himself does not live as he wishes, until he has arrived where
he cannot die, be deceived, or injured, and until he is assured
that this shall be his eternal condition. For this nature demands;
and nature is not fully and perfectly blessed till it
attains what it seeks. But what man is at present able to
live as he wishes, when it is not in his power so much as to
live? He wishes to live, he is compelled to die. How, then,
does he live as he wishes who does not live as long as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
wishes? or if he wishes to die, how can he live as he wishes,
since he does not wish even to live? Or if he wishes to die,
not because he dislikes life, but that after death he may live
better, still he is not yet living as he wishes, but only has the
prospect of so living when, through death, he reaches that
which he wishes. But admit that he lives as he wishes,
because he has done violence to himself, and forced himself
not to wish what he cannot obtain, and to wish only what he
can (as Terence has it, "Since you cannot do what you will,
will what you can"<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a>), is he therefore blessed because he is
patiently wretched? For a blessed life is possessed only by
the man who loves it. If it is loved and possessed, it must
necessarily be more ardently loved than all besides; for whatever
else is loved must be loved for the sake of the blessed
life. And if it is loved as it deserves to be,&mdash;and the man
is not blessed who does not love the blessed life as it deserves,&mdash;then
he who so loves it cannot but wish it to be eternal.
Therefore it shall then only be blessed when it is eternal.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>That we are to believe that in Paradise our first parents begat offspring
without blushing.</i></p>

<p>In Paradise, then, man lived as he desired so long as he
desired what God had commanded. He lived in the enjoyment
of God, and was good by God's goodness; he lived without any
want, and had it in his power so to live eternally. He had
food that he might not hunger, drink that he might not thirst,
the tree of life that old age might not waste him. There was
in his body no corruption, nor seed of corruption, which could
produce in him any unpleasant sensation. He feared no inward
disease, no outward accident. Soundest health blessed
his body, absolute tranquillity his soul. As in Paradise there
was no excessive heat or cold, so its inhabitants were exempt
from the vicissitudes of fear and desire. No sadness of any
kind was there, nor any foolish joy; true gladness ceaselessly
flowed from the presence of God, who was loved "out of a
pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The honest love of husband and wife made a sure harmony
between them. Body and spirit worked harmoniously together,
and the commandment was kept without labour. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
languor made their leisure wearisome; no sleepiness interrupted
their desire to labour.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> In tanta facilitate rerum et

cum tranquillitate animi et corporis nulla corruptione integritatis

We speak of things which are now shameful, and
although we try, as well as we are able, to conceive them as
they were before they became shameful, yet necessity compels
us rather to limit our discussion to the bounds set by
modesty than to extend it as our moderate faculty of discourse
might suggest. For since that which I have been
speaking of was not experienced even by those who might
have experienced it,&mdash;I mean our first parents (for sin and its
merited banishment from Paradise anticipated this passionless
generation on their part),&mdash;when sexual intercourse is spoken
of now, it suggests to men's thoughts not such a placid obedience
to the will as is conceivable in our first parents, but
such violent acting of lust as they themselves have experienced.
And therefore modesty shuts my mouth, although my mind
conceives the matter clearly. But Almighty God, the supreme
and supremely good Creator of all natures, who aids and rewards
good wills, while He abandons and condemns the bad,
and rules both, was not destitute of a plan by which He
might people His city with the fixed number of citizens which
His wisdom had foreordained even out of the condemned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
human race, discriminating them not now by merits, since
the whole mass was condemned as if in a vitiated root, but
by grace, and showing, not only in the case of the redeemed,
but also in those who were not delivered, how much grace
He has bestowed upon them. For every one acknowledges
that he has been rescued from evil, not by deserved, but by
gratuitous goodness, when he is singled out from the company
of those with whom he might justly have borne a common
punishment, and is allowed to go scathless. Why, then,
should God not have created those whom He foresaw would
sin, since He was able to show in and by them both what their
guilt merited, and what His grace bestowed, and since, under
His creating and disposing hand, even the perverse disorder
of the wicked could not pervert the right order of things?</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Of the angels and men who sinned, and that their wickedness did not
disturb the order of God's providence.</i></p>

<p>The sins of men and angels do nothing to impede the
"great works of the Lord which accomplish His will."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> For
He who by His providence and omnipotence distributes to
every one his own portion, is able to make good use not only
of the good, but also of the wicked. And thus making a
good use of the wicked angel, who, in punishment of his first
wicked volition, was doomed to an obduracy that prevents
him now from willing any good, why should not God have
permitted him to tempt the first man, who had been created
upright, that is to say, with a good will? For he had been
so constituted, that if he looked to God for help, man's goodness
should defeat the angel's wickedness; but if by proud
self-pleasing he abandoned God, his Creator and Sustainer,
he should be conquered. If his will remained upright,
through leaning on God's help, he should be rewarded; if it
became wicked, by forsaking God, he should be punished.
But even this trusting in God's help could not itself be
accomplished without God's help, although man had it in his
own power to relinquish the benefits of divine grace by pleasing
himself. For as it is not in our power to live in this
world without sustaining ourselves by food, while it is in our
power to refuse this nourishment and cease to live, as those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
do who kill themselves, so it was not in man's power, even in
Paradise, to live as he ought without God's help; but it was
in his power to live wickedly, though thus he should cut
short his happiness, and incur very just punishment. Since,
then, God was not ignorant that man would fall, why should
He not have suffered him to be tempted by an angel who
hated and envied him? It was not, indeed, that He was
unaware that he should be conquered, but because He foresaw
that by the man's seed, aided by divine grace, this same devil
himself should be conquered, to the greater glory of the
saints. All was brought about in such a manner, that neither
did any future event escape God's foreknowledge, nor did His
foreknowledge compel any one to sin, and so as to demonstrate
in the experience of the intelligent creation, human
and angelic, how great a difference there is between the
private presumption of the creature and the Creator's protection.
For who will dare to believe or say that it was not in
God's power to prevent both angels and men from sinning?
But God preferred to leave this in their power, and thus to
show both what evil could be wrought by their pride, and
what good by His grace.</p>

<p>Accordingly, two cities have been formed by two loves:

self. The former, in a word, glories in itself, the latter in

greatest glory of the other is God, the witness of conscience.

<p class="center">1. <i>Of the two lines of the human race which from first to last divide it.</i></p>

<p>OF the bliss of Paradise, of Paradise itself, and of the life
of our first parents there, and of their sin and punishment,
many have thought much, spoken much, written much.
We ourselves, too, have spoken of these things in the foregoing
books, and have written either what we read in the
Holy Scriptures, or what we could reasonably deduce from
them. And were we to enter into a more detailed investigation
of these matters, an endless number of endless questions
would arise, which would involve us in a larger work than the
present occasion admits. We cannot be expected to find
room for replying to every question that may be started by
unoccupied and captious men, who are ever more ready to ask
questions than capable of understanding the answer. Yet I
trust we have already done justice to these great and difficult
questions regarding the beginning of the world, or of the soul,
or of the human race itself. This race we have distributed
into two parts, the one consisting of those who live according
to man, the other of those who live according to God. And
these we also mystically call the two cities, or the two communities
of men, of which the one is predestined to reign
eternally with God, and the other to suffer eternal punishment
with the devil. This, however, is their end, and of it
we are to speak afterwards. At present, as we have said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
enough about their origin, whether among the angels, whose
numbers we know not, or in the two first human beings, it
seems suitable to attempt an account of their career, from the
time when our two first parents began to propagate the race
until all human generation shall cease. For this whole time
or world-age, in which the dying give place and those who
are born succeed, is the career of these two cities concerning
which we treat.</p>

<p>Of these two first parents of the human race, then, Cain
was the first-born, and he belonged to the city of men; after
him was born Abel, who belonged to the city of God. For
as in the individual the truth of the apostle's statement is
discerned, "that is not first which is spiritual, but that which
is natural, and afterward that which is spiritual,"<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> whence
it comes to pass that each man, being derived from a condemned
stock, is first of all born of Adam evil and carnal,
and becomes good and spiritual only afterwards, when he is
grafted into Christ by regeneration: so was it in the human
race as a whole. When these two cities began to run their
course by a series of deaths and births, the citizen of this
world was the first-born, and after him the stranger in this
world, the citizen of the city of God, predestinated by grace,
elected by grace, by grace a stranger below, and by grace a
citizen above. By grace,&mdash;for so far as regards himself he is
sprung from the same mass, all of which is condemned in its
origin; but God, like a potter (for this comparison is introduced
by the apostle judiciously, and not without thought),
of the same lump made one vessel to honour, another to dishonour.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
But first the vessel to dishonour was made, and
after it another to honour. For in each individual, as I have
already said, there is first of all that which is reprobate, that
from which we must begin, but in which we need not necessarily
remain; afterwards is that which is well-approved, to
which we may by advancing attain, and in which, when we
have reached it, we may abide. Not, indeed, that every
wicked man shall be good, but that no one will be good who
was not first of all wicked; but the sooner any one becomes
a good man, the more speedily does he receive this title, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
abolish the old name in the new. Accordingly, it is recorded
of Cain that he built a city,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> but Abel, being a sojourner,
built none. For the city of the saints is above, although
here below it begets citizens, in whom it sojourns till the
time of its reign arrives, when it shall gather together all in
the day of the resurrection; and then shall the promised
kingdom be given to them, in which they shall reign with
their Prince, the King of the ages, time without end.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of the children of the flesh and the children of the promise.</i></p>

<p>There was indeed on earth, so long as it was needed, a
symbol and foreshadowing image of this city, which served
the purpose of reminding men that such a city was to be,
rather than of making it present; and this image was itself
called the holy city, as a symbol of the future city, though
not itself the reality. Of this city which served as an image,
and of that free city it typified, Paul writes to the Galatians
in these terms: "Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law,
do ye not hear the law? For it is written, that Abraham
had two sons, the one by a bond maid, the other by a free
woman. But he who was of the bond woman was born after
the flesh, but he of the free woman was by promise. Which
things are an allegory:<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> for these are the two covenants;
the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage,
which is Agar. For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and
answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with
her children. But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is
the mother of us all. For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren
that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not:
for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath
an husband. Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children
of promise. But as then he that was born after the
flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it
is now. Nevertheless, what saith the Scripture? Cast out
the bond woman and her son: for the son of the bond woman
shall not be heir with the son of the free woman. And
we, brethren, are not children of the bond woman, but of
the free, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
This interpretation of the passage, handed down to us with
apostolic authority, shows how we ought to understand the
Scriptures of the two covenants&mdash;the old and the new. One
portion of the earthly city became an image of the heavenly
city, not having a significance of its own, but signifying
another city, and therefore serving, or "being in bondage."
For it was founded not for its own sake, but to prefigure
another city; and this shadow of a city was also itself foreshadowed
by another preceding figure. For Sarah's handmaid
Agar, and her son, were an image of this image. And as the
shadows were to pass away when the full light came, Sarah,
the free woman, who prefigured the free city (which again was
also prefigured in another way by that shadow of a city Jerusalem),
therefore said, "Cast out the bond woman and her son;
for the son of the bond woman shall not be heir with my
son Isaac," or, as the apostle says, "with the son of the free
woman." In the earthly city, then, we find two things&mdash;its
own obvious presence, and its symbolic presentation of the
heavenly city. Now citizens are begotten to the earthly city
by nature vitiated by sin, but to the heavenly city by grace freeing
nature from sin; whence the former are called "vessels of
wrath," the latter "vessels of mercy."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> And this was typified
in the two sons of Abraham,&mdash;Ishmael, the son of Agar the
handmaid, being born according to the flesh, while Isaac was
born of the free woman Sarah, according to the promise. Both,
indeed, were of Abraham's seed; but the one was begotten by
natural law, the other was given by gracious promise. In the
one birth, human action is revealed; in the other, a divine
kindness comes to light.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>That Sarah's barrenness was made productive by God's grace.</i></p>

<p>Sarah, in fact, was barren; and, despairing of offspring, and
being resolved that she would have at least through her handmaid
that blessing she saw she could not in her own person
procure, she gave her handmaid to her husband, to whom she
herself had been unable to bear children. From him she required
this conjugal duty, exercising her own right in another's
womb. And thus Ishmael was born according to the common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
law of human generation, by sexual intercourse. Therefore it
is said that he was born "according to the flesh,"&mdash;not because
such births are not the gifts of God, nor His handiwork, whose
creative wisdom "reaches," as it is written, "from one end to
another mightily, and sweetly doth she order all things,"<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
but because, in a case in which the gift of God, which was
not due to men and was the gratuitous largess of grace, was
to be conspicuous, it was requisite that a son be given in
a way which no effort of nature could compass. Nature
denies children to persons of the age which Abraham and
Sarah had now reached; besides that, in Sarah's case, she was
barren even in her prime. This nature, so constituted that
offspring could not be looked for, symbolized the nature of
the human race vitiated by sin and by just consequence condemned,
which deserves no future felicity. Fitly, therefore,
does Isaac, the child of promise, typify the children of grace,
the citizens of the free city, who dwell together in everlasting
peace, in which self-love and self-will have no place, but a
ministering love that rejoices in the common joy of all, of
many hearts makes one, that is to say, secures a perfect
concord.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Of the conflict and peace of the earthly city.</i></p>

<p>But the earthly city, which shall not be everlasting (for it
will no longer be a city when it has been committed to the
extreme penalty), has its good in this world, and rejoices in
it with such joy as such things can afford. But as this is
not a good which can discharge its devotees of all distresses,
this city is often divided against itself by litigations, wars,
quarrels, and such victories as are either life-destroying or
short-lived. For each part of it that arms against another
part of it seeks to triumph over the nations through itself in
bondage to vice. If, when it has conquered, it is inflated with
pride, its victory is life-destroying; but if it turns its thoughts
upon the common casualties of our mortal condition, and is
rather anxious concerning the disasters that may befall it
than elated with the successes already achieved, this victory,
though of a higher kind, is still only short-lived; for it cannot
abidingly rule over those whom it has victoriously subjugated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
But the things which this city desires cannot justly
be said to be evil, for it is itself, in its own kind, better than
all other human good. For it desires earthly peace for the
sake of enjoying earthly goods, and it makes war in order to
attain to this peace; since, if it has conquered, and there
remains no one to resist it, it enjoys a peace which it had not
while there were opposing parties who contested for the enjoyment
of those things which were too small to satisfy both.
This peace is purchased by toilsome wars; it is obtained by
what they style a glorious victory. Now, when victory remains
with the party which had the juster cause, who hesitates
to congratulate the victor, and style it a desirable peace?
These things, then, are good things, and without doubt the
gifts of God. But if they neglect the better things of the
heavenly city, which are secured by eternal victory and peace
never-ending, and so inordinately covet these present good
things that they believe them to be the only desirable things,
or love them better than those things which are believed to
be better,&mdash;if this be so, then it is necessary that misery
follow and ever increase.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of the fratricidal act of the founder of the earthly city, and the corresponding
crime of the founder of Rome.</i></p>

<p>Thus the founder of the earthly city was a fratricide.
Overcome with envy, he slew his own brother, a citizen of
the eternal city, and a sojourner on earth. So that we cannot
be surprised that this first specimen, or, as the Greeks say,
archetype of crime, should, long afterwards, find a corresponding
crime at the foundation of that city which was destined
to reign over so many nations, and be the head of this earthly
city of which we speak. For of that city also, as one of their
poets has mentioned, "the first walls were stained with a
brother's blood,"<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> or, as Roman history records, Remus was
slain by his brother Romulus. And thus there is no difference
between the foundation of this city and of the earthly
city, unless it be that Romulus and Remus were both citizens
of the earthly city. Both desired to have the glory of founding
the Roman republic, but both could not have as much
glory as if one only claimed it; for he who wished to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
the glory of ruling would certainly rule less if his power were
shared by a living consort. In order, therefore, that the
whole glory might be enjoyed by one, his consort was removed;
and by this crime the empire was made larger indeed,
but inferior, while otherwise it would have been less, but
better. Now these brothers, Cain and Abel, were not both
animated by the same earthly desires, nor did the murderer
envy the other because he feared that, by both ruling, his own
dominion would be curtailed,&mdash;for Abel was not solicitous to
rule in that city which his brother built,&mdash;he was moved by
that diabolical, envious hatred with which the evil regard the
good, for no other reason than because they are good while
themselves are evil. For the possession of goodness is by no
means diminished by being shared with a partner either permanent
or temporarily assumed; on the contrary, the possession
of goodness is increased in proportion to the concord and
charity of each of those who share it. In short, he who is
unwilling to share this possession cannot have it; and he who
is most willing to admit others to a share of it will have the
greatest abundance to himself. The quarrel, then, between
Romulus and Remus shows how the earthly city is divided
against itself; that which fell out between Cain and Abel
illustrated the hatred that subsists between the two cities, that
of God and that of men. The wicked war with the wicked;
the good also war with the wicked. But with the good, good
men, or at least perfectly good men, cannot war; though,
while only going on towards perfection, they war to this extent,
that every good man resists others in those points in
which he resists himself. And in each individual "the flesh
lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a>
This spiritual lusting, therefore, can be at war with the carnal
lust of another man; or carnal lust may be at war with the
spiritual desires of another, in some such way as good and
wicked men are at war; or, still more certainly, the carnal
lusts of two men, good but not yet perfect, contend together,
just as the wicked contend with the wicked, until the health
of those who are under the treatment of grace attains final
victory.</p>

no man can see the Lord,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> many precepts are given which
carefully inculcate mutual forgiveness; among which we may
number that terrible word in which the servant is ordered to
pay his formerly remitted debt of ten thousand talents, because
he did not remit to his fellow-servant his debt of two hundred
pence. To which parable the Lord Jesus added the words, "So
likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye from
your hearts forgive not every one his brother."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> It is thus
the citizens of the city of God are healed while still they sojourn
in this earth and sigh for the peace of their heavenly
country. The Holy Spirit, too, works within, that the medicine
externally applied may have some good result. Otherwise,
even though God Himself make use of the creatures
that are subject to Him, and in some human form address our
human senses, whether we receive those impressions in sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
or in some external appearance, still, if He does not by His
own inward grace sway and act upon the mind, no preaching
of the truth is of any avail. But this God does, distinguishing
between the vessels of wrath and the vessels of mercy, by
His own very secret but very just providence. When He
Himself aids the soul in His own hidden and wonderful ways,
and the sin which dwells in our members, and is, as the
apostle teaches, rather the punishment of sin, does not reign
in our mortal body to obey the lusts of it, and when we no
longer yield our members as instruments of unrighteousness,<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
then the soul is converted from its own evil and selfish desires,
and, God possessing it, it possesses itself in peace even
in this life, and afterwards, with perfected health and endowed
with immortality, will reign without sin in peace everlasting.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Of the cause of Cain's crime and his obstinacy, which not even the word of
God could subdue.</i></p>

<p>But though God made use of this very mode of address
which we have been endeavouring to explain, and spoke to
Cain in that form by which He was wont to accommodate
Himself to our first parents and converse with them as a
companion, what good influence had it on Cain? Did he not
fulfil his wicked intention of killing his brother even after
he was warned by God's voice? For when God had made a
distinction between their sacrifices, neglecting Cain's, regarding
Abel's, which was doubtless intimated by some visible
sign to that effect; and when God had done so because the
works of the one were evil but those of his brother good, Cain
was very wroth, and his countenance fell. For thus it is
written: "And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth,
and why is thy countenance fallen? If thou offerest rightly,
but dost not rightly distinguish, hast thou not sinned? Fret
not thyself, for unto thee shall be his turning, and thou shalt
rule over him."<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> In this admonition administered by God to
Cain, that clause indeed, "If thou offerest rightly, but dost
not rightly distinguish, hast thou not sinned?" is obscure, inasmuch
as it is not apparent for what reason or purpose it was
spoken, and many meanings have been put upon it, as each
one who discusses it attempts to interpret it according to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
rule of faith. The truth is, that a sacrifice is "rightly offered"
when it is offered to the true God, to whom alone we must
sacrifice. And it is "not rightly distinguished" when we do
not rightly distinguish the places or seasons or materials of
the offering, or the person offering, or the person to whom it
is presented, or those to whom it is distributed for food after
the oblation. Distinguishing<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> is here used for discriminating,&mdash;whether
when an offering is made in a place where it ought
not or of a material which ought to be offered not there but
elsewhere; or when an offering is made at a wrong time, or
of a material suitable not then but at some other time; or when
that is offered which in no place nor any time ought to be
offered; or when a man keeps to himself choicer specimens
of the same kind than he offers to God; or when he or any
other who may not lawfully partake profanely eats of the oblation.
In which of these particulars Cain displeased God, it is
difficult to determine. But the Apostle John, speaking of
these brothers, says, "Not as Cain, who was of that wicked
one, and slew his brother. And wherefore slew he him? Because
his own works were evil, and his brother's righteous."<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
He thus gives us to understand that God did not respect his
offering because it was not rightly "distinguished" in this, that
he gave to God something of his own but kept himself to himself.
For this all do who follow not God's will but their
own, who live not with an upright but a crooked heart, and
yet offer to God such gifts as they suppose will procure from
Him that He aid them not by healing but by gratifying their
evil passions. And this is the characteristic of the earthly
city, that it worships God or gods who may aid it in reigning
victoriously and peacefully on earth not through love of doing
good, but through lust of rule. The good use the world that
they may enjoy God: the wicked, on the contrary, that they
may enjoy the world would fain use God,&mdash;those of them, at
least, who have attained to the belief that He is and takes an
interest in human affairs. For they who have not yet attained
even to this belief are still at a much lower level. Cain, then,
when he saw that God had respect to his brother's sacrifice,
but not to his own, should have humbly chosen his good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
brother as his example, and not proudly counted him his
rival. But he was wroth, and his countenance fell. This angry
regret for another person's goodness, even his brother's, was
charged upon him by God as a great sin. And He accused him
of it in the interrogation, "Why art thou wroth, and why is thy
countenance fallen?" For God saw that he envied his brother,
and of this He accused him. For to men, from whom the
heart of their fellow is hid, it might be doubtful and quite
uncertain whether that sadness bewailed his own wickedness
by which, as he had learned, he had displeased God, or his
brother's goodness, which had pleased God, and won His
favourable regard to his sacrifice. But God, in giving the
reason why He refused to accept Cain's offering and why
Cain should rather have been displeased at himself than at
his brother, shows him that though he was unjust in "not
rightly distinguishing," that is, not rightly living and being
unworthy to have his offering received, he was more unjust by
far in hating his just brother without a cause.</p>

<p>Yet He does not dismiss him without counsel, holy, just,
and good. "Fret not thyself," He says, "for unto thee shall
be his turning, and thou shalt rule over him." Over his
brother, does He mean? Most certainly not. Over what, then,
but sin? For He had said, "Thou hast sinned," and then
He added, "Fret not thyself, for to thee shall be its turning,
and thou shalt rule over it."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> And the "turning" of sin to
the man can be understood of his conviction that the guilt of
sin can be laid at no other man's door but his own. For this
is the health-giving medicine of penitence, and the fit plea
for pardon; so that, when it is said, "To thee its turning," we
must not supply "shall be," but we must read, "To thee let its
turning be," understanding it as a command, not as a prediction.
For then shall a man rule over his sin when he does
not prefer it to himself and defend it, but subjects it by repentance;
otherwise he that becomes protector of it shall surely
become its prisoner. But if we understand this sin to be that
carnal concupiscence of which the apostle says, "The flesh
lusteth against the spirit,"<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> among the fruits of which lust he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
names envy, by which assuredly Cain was stung and excited
to destroy his brother, then we may properly supply the
words "shall be," and read, "To thee shall be its turning, and
thou shalt rule over it." For when the carnal part which the
apostle calls sin, in that place where he says, "It is not I who
do it, but sin that dwelleth in me,"<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> that part which the
philosophers also call vicious, and which ought not to lead the
mind, but which the mind ought to rule and restrain by reason
from illicit motions,&mdash;when, then, this part has been moved to
perpetrate any wickedness, if it be curbed and if it obey the
word of the apostle, "Yield not your members instruments of
unrighteousness unto sin,"<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> it is turned towards the mind and
subdued and conquered by it, so that reason rules over it as
a subject. It was this which God enjoined on him who was
kindled with the fire of envy against his brother, so that he
sought to put out of the way him whom he should have set
as an example. "Fret not thyself," or compose thyself, He
says: withhold thy hand from crime; let not sin reign in
your mortal body to fulfil it in the lusts thereof, nor yield
your members instruments of unrighteousness unto sin. "For
to thee shall be its turning," so long as you do not encourage
it by giving it the rein, but bridle it by quenching its fire.
"And thou shalt rule over it;" for when it is not allowed any
external actings, it yields itself to the rule of the governing
mind and righteous will, and ceases from even internal motions.
There is something similar said in the same divine
book of the woman, when God questioned and judged them
after their sin, and pronounced sentence on them all,&mdash;the devil
in the form of the serpent, the woman and her husband in
their own persons. For when He had said to her, "I will
greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception; in sorrow
shalt thou bring forth children," then He added, "and thy
turning shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee."<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
What is said to Cain about his sin, or about the vicious concupiscence
of his flesh, is here said of the woman who had
sinned; and we are to understand that the husband is to rule
his wife as the soul rules the flesh. And therefore, says the
apostle, "He that loveth his wife, loveth himself; for no man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
ever yet hated his own flesh."<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> This flesh, then, is to be
healed, because it belongs to ourselves: is not to be abandoned
to destruction as if it were alien to our nature. But Cain received
that counsel of God in the spirit of one who did not
wish to amend. In fact, the vice of envy grew stronger in him;
and, having entrapped his brother, he slew him. Such was
the founder of the earthly city. He was also a figure of the
Jews who slew Christ the Shepherd of the flock of men, prefigured
by Abel the shepherd of sheep: but as this is an allegorical
and prophetical matter, I forbear to explain it now;
besides, I remember that I have made some remarks upon it
in writing against Faustus the Manich√¶an.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>


<p class="center">8. <i>What Cain's reason was for building a city so early in the history
of the human race.</i></p>

<p>At present it is the history which I aim at defending, that
Scripture may not be reckoned incredible when it relates that
one man built a city at a time in which there seem to have
been but four men upon earth, or rather indeed but three,
after one brother slew the other,&mdash;to wit, the first man the
father of all, and Cain himself, and his son Enoch, by whose
name the city was itself called. But they who are moved by
this consideration forget to take into account that the writer
of the sacred history does not necessarily mention all the
men who might be alive at that time, but those only whom
the scope of his work required him to name. The design of
that writer (who in this matter was the instrument of the
Holy Ghost) was to descend to Abraham through the successions
of ascertained generations propagated from one man,
and then to pass from Abraham's seed to the people of God,
in whom, separated as they were from other nations, was
prefigured and predicted all that relates to the city whose
reign is eternal, and to its king and founder Christ, which
things were foreseen in the Spirit as destined to come; yet
neither is this object so effected as that nothing is said of the
other society of men which we call the earthly city, but
mention is made of it so far as seemed needful to enhance
the glory of the heavenly city by contrast to its opposite.
Accordingly, when the divine Scripture, in mentioning the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
number of years which those men lived, concludes its account
of each man of whom it speaks, with the words, "And he
begat sons and daughters, and all his days were so and so,
and he died," are we to understand that, because it does not
name those sons and daughters, therefore, during that long
term of years over which one lifetime extended in those early
days, there might not have been born very many men, by
whose united numbers not one but several cities might have
been built? But it suited the purpose of God, by whose
inspiration these histories were composed, to arrange and distinguish
from the first these two societies in their several
generations,&mdash;that on the one side the generations of men,
that is to say, of those who live according to man, and on the
other side the generations of the sons of God, that is to
say, of men living according to God, might be traced down
together and yet apart from one another as far as the deluge,
at which point their dissociation and association are exhibited:
their dissociation, inasmuch as the generations of both lines
are recorded in separate tables, the one line descending from
the fratricide Cain, the other from Seth, who had been born to
Adam instead of him whom his brother slew; their association,
inasmuch as the good so deteriorated that the whole race
became of such a character that it was swept away by the
deluge, with the exception of one just man, whose name was
Noah, and his wife and three sons and three daughters-in-law,
which eight persons were alone deemed worthy to escape
from that desolating visitation which destroyed all men.</p>

<p>Therefore, although it is written, "And Cain knew his wife,
and she conceived and bare Enoch, and he builded a city and
called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch,"<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>
it does not follow that we are to believe this to have been
his first-born; for we cannot suppose that this is proved by
the expression "he knew his wife," as if then for the first
time he had had intercourse with her. For in the case of
Adam, the father of all, this expression is used not only when
Cain, who seems to have been his first-born, was conceived,
but also afterwards the same Scripture says, "Adam knew
Eve his wife, and she conceived and bare a son, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
called his name Seth."<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> Whence it is obvious that Scripture
employs this expression neither always when a birth is recorded
nor then only when the birth of a first-born is mentioned.
Neither is it necessary to suppose that Enoch was
Cain's first-born because he named his city after him. For
it is quite possible that though he had other sons, yet for
some reason the father loved him more than the rest. Judah
was not the first-born, though he gives his name to Jud√¶a
and the Jews. But even though Enoch was the first-born of
the city's founder, that is no reason for supposing that the
father named the city after him as soon as he was born; for
at that time he, being but a solitary man, could not have
founded a civic community, which is nothing else than a
multitude of men bound together by some associating tie.
But when his family increased to such numbers that he had
quite a population, then it became possible to him both to
build a city, and give it, when founded, the name of his son.
For so long was the life of those antediluvians, that he who
lived the shortest time of those whose years are mentioned in
Scripture attained to the age of 753 years.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> And though no
one attained the age of a thousand years, several exceeded the
age of nine hundred. Who then can doubt that during the
lifetime of one man the human race might be so multiplied that
there would be a population to build and occupy not one but
several cities? And this might very readily be conjectured
from the fact that from one man, Abraham, in not much more
than four hundred years, the numbers of the Hebrew race so
increased, that in the exodus of that people from Egypt there
are recorded to have been six hundred thousand men capable
of bearing arms,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> and this over and above the Idum√¶ans, who,
though not numbered with Israel's descendants, were yet sprung
from his brother, also a grandson of Abraham; and over and
above the other nations which were of the same stock of
Abraham, though not through Sarah,&mdash;that is, his descendants
by Hagar and Keturah, the Ishmaelites, Midianites, etc.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Of the long life and greater stature of the antediluvians.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore no one who considerately weighs facts will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
doubt that Cain might have built a city, and that a large
one, when it is observed how prolonged were the lives of
men, unless perhaps some sceptic take exception to this very
length of years which our authors ascribe to the antediluvians
and deny that this is credible. And so, too, they do
not believe that the size of men's bodies was larger then than
now, though the most esteemed of their own poets, Virgil,
asserts the same, when he speaks of that huge stone which
had been fixed as a landmark, and which a strong man of
those ancient times snatched up as he fought, and ran, and
hurled, and cast it,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Scarce twelve strong men of later mould<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That weight could on their necks uphold;"<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>thus declaring his opinion that the earth then produced
mightier men. And if in the more recent times, how much
more in the ages before the world-renowned deluge? But
the large size of the primitive human body is often proved to
the incredulous by the exposure of sepulchres, either through
the wear of time or the violence of torrents or some accident,
and in which bones of incredible size have been found or have
rolled out. I myself, along with some others, saw on the
shore at Utica a man's molar tooth of such a size, that if it
were cut down into teeth such as we have, a hundred, I
fancy, could have been made out of it. But that, I believe,
belonged to some giant. For though the bodies of ordinary
men were then larger than ours, the giants surpassed all in
stature. And neither in our own age nor any other have
there been altogether wanting instances of gigantic stature,
though they may be few. The younger Pliny, a most learned
man, maintains that the older the world becomes, the smaller
will be the bodies of men.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> And he mentions that Homer
in his poems often lamented the same decline; and this he
does not laugh at as a poetical figment, but in his character
of a recorder of natural wonders accepts it as historically true.
But, as I said, the bones which are from time to time discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
prove the size of the bodies of the ancients,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> and will
do so to future ages, for they are slow to decay. But the
length of an antediluvian's life cannot now be proved by any
such monumental evidence. But we are not on this account
to withhold our faith from the sacred history, whose statements
of past fact we are the more inexcusable in discrediting,
as we see the accuracy of its prediction of what was future.
And even that same Pliny<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> tells us that there is still a nation
in which men live 200 years. If, then, in places unknown
to us, men are believed to have a length of days which is
quite beyond our own experience, why should we not believe
the same of times distant from our own? Or are we to
believe that in other places there is what is not here, while
we do not believe that in other times there has been anything
but what is now?</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Of the different computation of the ages of the antediluvians, given by the
Hebrew manuscripts and by our own.</i><a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p>Wherefore, although there is a discrepancy for which I
cannot account between our manuscripts and the Hebrew, in
the very number of years assigned to the antediluvians, yet
the discrepancy is not so great that they do not agree about
their longevity. For the very first man, Adam, before he
begot his son Seth, is in our manuscripts found to have lived
230 years, but in the Hebrew <span class="smcap">mss.</span> 130. But after he begot
Seth, our copies read that he lived 700 years, while the
Hebrew give 800. And thus, when the two periods are taken
together, the sum agrees. And so throughout the succeeding
generations, the period before the father begets a son is always
made shorter by 100 years in the Hebrew, but the period
after his son is begotten is longer by 100 years in the
Hebrew than in our copies. And thus, taking the two periods
together, the result is the same in both. And in the sixth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
generation there is no discrepancy at all. In the seventh,
however, of which Enoch is the representative, who is recorded
to have been translated without death because he
pleased God, there is the same discrepancy as in the first
five generations, 100 years more being ascribed to him by
our <span class="smcap">mss.</span> before he begat a son. But still the result agrees;
for according to both documents he lived before he was
translated 365 years. In the eighth generation the discrepancy
is less than in the others, and of a different kind. For
Methuselah, whom Enoch begat, lived, before he begat his
successor, not 100 years less, but 100 years more, according
to the Hebrew reading; and in our <span class="smcap">mss.</span> again these years
are added to the period after he begat his son; so that in this
case also the sum-total is the same. And it is only in the
ninth generation, that is, in the age of Lamech, Methuselah's
son and Noah's father, that there is a discrepancy in the sum-total;
and even in this case it is slight. For the Hebrew <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
represent him as living twenty-four years more than ours
assign to him. For before he begat his son, who was called
Noah, six years fewer are given to him by the Hebrew <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
than by ours; but after he begat this son, they give him thirty
years more than ours; so that, deducting the former six, there
remains, as we said, a surplus of twenty-four.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of Methuselah's age, which seems to extend fourteen years beyond the
deluge.</i></p>

<p>From this discrepancy between the Hebrew books and our
own arises the well-known question as to the age of Methuselah;<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a>
for it is computed that he lived for fourteen years
after the deluge, though Scripture relates that of all who
were then upon the earth only the eight souls in the ark
escaped destruction by the flood, and of these Methuselah was
not one. For, according to our books, Methuselah, before he
begat the son whom he called Lamech, lived 167 years; then
Lamech himself, before his son Noah was born, lived 188
years, which together make 355 years. Add to these the
age of Noah at the date of the deluge, 600 years, and this
gives a total of 955 from the birth of Methuselah to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
year of the flood. Now all the years of the life of Methuselah
are computed to be 969; for when he had lived 167
years, and had begotten his son Lamech, he then lived after
this 802 years, which makes a total, as we said, of 969
years. From this, if we deduct 955 years from the birth of
Methuselah to the flood, there remain fourteen years, which
he is supposed to have lived after the flood. And therefore
some suppose that, though he was not on earth (in which it
is agreed that every living thing which could not naturally
live in water perished), he was for a time with his father,
who had been translated, and that he lived there till the flood
had passed away. This hypothesis they adopt, that they may
not cast a slight on the trustworthiness of versions which the
Church has received into a position of high authority,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and
because they believe that the Jewish <span class="smcap">mss.</span> rather than our
own are in error. For they do not admit that this is a mistake
of the translators, but maintain that there is a falsified
statement in the original, from which, through the Greek, the
Scripture has been translated into our own tongue. They say
that it is not credible that the seventy translators, who simultaneously
and unanimously produced one rendering, could
have erred, or, in a case in which no interest of theirs was
involved, could have falsified their translation; but that the
Jews, envying us our translation of their Law and Prophets,
have made alterations in their texts so as to undermine the
authority of ours. This opinion or suspicion let each man
adopt according to his own judgment. Certain it is that
Methuselah did not survive the flood, but died in the very
year it occurred, if the numbers given in the Hebrew <span class="smcap">mss.</span>
are true. My own opinion regarding the seventy translators
I will, with God's help, state more carefully in its
own place, when I have come down (following the order
which this work requires) to that period in which their
translation was executed.<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> For the present question, it is
enough that, according to our versions, the men of that age
had lives so long as to make it quite possible that, during
the lifetime of the first-born of the two sole parents then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
on earth, the human race multiplied sufficiently to form a
community.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Of the opinion of those who do not believe that in these primitive times men
lived so long as is stated.</i></p>

<p>For they are by no means to be listened to who suppose
that in those times years were differently reckoned, and were
so short that one of our years may be supposed to be equal
to ten of theirs. So that they say, when we read or hear that
some man lived 900 years, we should understand ninety,&mdash;ten
of those years making but one of ours, and ten of ours
equalling 100 of theirs. Consequently, as they suppose,
Adam was twenty-three years of age when he begat Seth, and
Seth himself was twenty years and six months old when his
son Enos was born, though the Scripture calls these months
205 years. For, on the hypothesis of those whose opinion we
are explaining, it was customary to divide one such year as
we have into ten parts, and to call each part a year. And
each of these parts was composed of six days squared; because
God finished His works in six days, that He might rest the
seventh. Of this I disputed according to my ability in the
eleventh book.<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Now six squared, or six times six, gives
thirty-six days; and this multiplied by ten amounts to 360
days, or twelve lunar months. As for the five remaining days
which are needed to complete the solar year, and for the
fourth part of a day, which requires that into every fourth or
leap-year a day be added, the ancients added such days as the
Romans used to call "intercalary," in order to complete the
number of the years. So that Enos, Seth's son, was nineteen
years old when his son Cainan was born, though Scripture
calls these years 190. And so through all the generations in
which the ages of the antediluvians are given, we find in our
versions that almost no one begat a son at the age of 100 or
under, or even at the age of 120 or thereabouts; but the
youngest fathers are recorded to have been 160 years old and
upwards. And the reason of this, they say, is that no one
can beget children when he is ten years old, the age spoken
of by those men as 100, but that sixteen is the age of puberty,
and competent now to propagate offspring; and this is the age<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
called by them 160. And that it may not be thought incredible
that in these days the year was differently computed
from our own, they adduce what is recorded by several writers
of history, that the Egyptians had a year of four months, the
Acarnanians of six, and the Lavinians of thirteen months.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
The younger Pliny, after mentioning that some writers reported
that one man had lived 152 years, another ten more,
others 200, others 300, that some had even reached 500 and
600, and a few 800 years of age, gave it as his opinion that
all this must be ascribed to mistaken computation. For some,
he says, make summer and winter each a year; others make
each season a year, like the Arcadians, whose years, he says,
were of three months. He added, too, that the Egyptians, of
whose little years of four months we have spoken already,
sometimes terminated their year at the wane of each moon;
so that with them there are produced lifetimes of 1000
years.</p>

<p>By these plausible arguments certain persons, with no desire
to weaken the credit of this sacred history, but rather to
facilitate belief in it by removing the difficulty of such incredible
longevity, have been themselves persuaded, and think
they act wisely in persuading others, that in these days the
year was so brief that ten of their years equal but one of ours,
while ten of ours equal 100 of theirs. But there is the
plainest evidence to show that this is quite false. Before
producing this evidence, however, it seems right to mention
a conjecture which is yet more plausible. From the Hebrew
manuscripts we could at once refute this confident statement;
for in them Adam is found to have lived not 230 but 130
years before he begat his third son. If, then, this mean
thirteen years by our ordinary computation, then he must
have begotten his first son when he was only twelve or thereabouts.
Who can at this age beget children according to the
ordinary and familiar course of nature? But not to mention
him, since it is possible he may have been able to beget his
like as soon as he was created,&mdash;for it is not credible that he was
created so little as our infants are,&mdash;not to mention him, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
son was not 205 years old when he begat Enos, as our versions
have it, but 105, and consequently, according to this
idea, was not eleven years old. But what shall I say of his
son Cainan, who, though by our version 170 years old, was by
the Hebrew text seventy when he beget Mahalaleel? If
seventy years in those times meant only seven of our years,
what man of seven years old begets children?</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Whether, in computing years, we ought to follow the Hebrew or the
Septuagint.</i></p>

<p>But if I say this, I shall presently be answered, It is one
of the Jews' lies. This, however, we have disposed of above,
showing that it cannot be that men of so just a reputation as
the seventy translators should have falsified their version.
However, if I ask them which of the two is more credible,
that the Jewish nation, scattered far and wide, could have
unanimously conspired to forge this lie, and so, through envying
others the authority of their Scriptures, have deprived
themselves of their verity; or that seventy men, who were
also themselves Jews, shut up in one place (for Ptolemy king
of Egypt had got them together for this work), should have
envied foreign nations that same truth, and by common consent
inserted these errors: who does not see which can be
more naturally and readily believed? But far be it from any
prudent man to believe either that the Jews, however malicious
and wrong-headed, could have tampered with so many
and so widely-dispersed manuscripts; or that those renowned
seventy individuals had any common purpose to grudge the
truth to the nations. One must therefore more plausibly
maintain, that when first their labours began to be transcribed
from the copy in Ptolemy's library, some such misstatement
might find its way into the first copy made, and from it might
be disseminated far and wide; and that this might arise from
no fraud, but from a mere copyist's error. This is a sufficiently
plausible account of the difficulty regarding Methuselah's life,
and of that other case in which there is a difference in the
total of twenty-four years. But in those cases in which there
is a methodical resemblance in the falsification, so that uniformly
the one version allots to the period before a son and
successor is born 100 years more than the other, and to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
period subsequent 100 years less, and <i>vice vers√¢</i>, so that the
totals may agree,&mdash;and this holds true of the first, second,
third, fourth, fifth, and seventh generations,&mdash;in these cases
error seems to have, if we may say so, a certain kind of constancy,
and savours not of accident, but of design.</p>

<p>Accordingly, that diversity of numbers which distinguishes
the Hebrew from the Greek and Latin copies of Scripture,
and which consists of a uniform addition and deduction of
100 years in each lifetime for several consecutive generations,
is to be attributed neither to the malice of the Jews
nor to men so diligent and prudent as the seventy translators,
but to the error of the copyist who was first allowed
to transcribe the manuscript from the library of the above-mentioned
king. For even now, in cases where numbers
contribute nothing to the easier comprehension or more satisfactory
knowledge of anything, they are both carelessly
transcribed, and still more carelessly emended. For who will
trouble himself to learn how many thousand men the several
tribes of Israel contained? He sees no resulting benefit of
such knowledge. Or how many men are there who are aware
of the vast advantage that lies hid in this knowledge? But in
this case, in which during so many consecutive generations
100 years are added in one manuscript where they are not
reckoned in the other, and then, after the birth of the son
and successor, the years which were wanting are added, it is
obvious that the copyist who contrived this arrangement designed
to insinuate that the antediluvians lived an excessive
number of years only because each year was excessively brief,
and that he tried to draw the attention to this fact by his
statement of their age of puberty at which they became able
to beget children. For, lest the incredulous might stumble
at the difficulty of so long a lifetime, he insinuated that
100 of their years equalled but ten of ours; and this insinuation
he conveyed by adding 100 years whenever
he found the age below 160 years or thereabouts, deducting
these years again from the period after the son's
birth, that the total might harmonize. By this means he
intended to ascribe the generation of offspring to a fit age,
without diminishing the total sum of years ascribed to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
lifetime of the individuals. And the very fact that in the
sixth generation he departed from this uniform practice, inclines
us all the rather to believe that when the circumstance
we have referred to required his alterations, he made them;
seeing that when this circumstance did not exist, he made no
alteration. For in the same generation he found in the Hebrew
MS. that Jared lived before he begat Enoch 162 years, which,
according to the short year computation, is sixteen years and
somewhat less than two months, an age capable of procreation;
and therefore it was not necessary to add 100 short years,
and so make the age twenty-six years of the usual length;
and of course it was not necessary to deduct, after the son's
birth, years which he had not added before it. And thus it
comes to pass that in this instance there is no variation
between the two manuscripts.</p>

<p>This is corroborated still further by the fact that in the
eighth generation, while the Hebrew books assign 182<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
years to Methuselah before Lamech's birth, ours assign to
him twenty less, though usually 100 years are added to this
period; then, after Lamech's birth, the twenty years are restored,
so as to equalize the total in the two books. For if
his design was that these 170 years be understood as seventeen,
so as to suit the age of puberty, as there was no need
for him adding anything, so there was none for his subtracting
anything; for in this case he found an age fit for the generation
of children, for the sake of which he was in the habit of
adding those 100 years in cases where he did not find the
age already sufficient. This difference of twenty years we
might, indeed, have supposed had happened accidentally, had
he not taken care to restore them afterwards as he had
deducted them from the period before, so that there might
be no deficiency in the total. Or are we perhaps to suppose
that there was the still more astute design of concealing the
deliberate and uniform addition of 100 years to the first
period and their deduction from the subsequent period,&mdash;did
he design to conceal this by doing something similar, that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
say, adding and deducting, not indeed a century, but some
years, even in a case in which there was no need for his
doing so? But whatever may be thought of this, whether
it be believed that he did so or not, whether, in fine, it be
so or not, I would have no manner of doubt that when any
diversity is found in the books, since both cannot be true to
fact, we do well to believe in preference that language out
of which the translation was made into another by translators.
For there are three Greek <span class="smcap">mss.</span>, one Latin, and one Syriac,
which agree with one another, and in all of these Methuselah
is said to have died six years before the deluge.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>That the years in those ancient times were of the same length as our own.</i></p>

<p>Let us now see how it can be plainly made out that in the
enormously protracted lives of those men the years were not
so short that ten of their years were equal to only one of ours,
but were of as great length as our own, which are measured
by the course of the sun. It is proved by this, that Scripture
states that the flood occurred in the six hundredth year of
Noah's life. But why in the same place is it also written,
"The waters of the flood were upon the earth in the six
hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the
twenty-seventh day of the month,"<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> if that very brief year (of
which it took ten to make one of ours) consisted of thirty-six
days? For so scant a year, if the ancient usage dignified
it with the name of year, either has not months, or its month
must be three days, so that it may have twelve of them. How
then was it here said, "In the six hundredth year, the second
month, the twenty-seventh day of the month," unless the
months then were of the same length as the months now?
For how else could it be said that the flood began on the
twenty-seventh day of the second month? Then afterwards,
at the end of the flood, it is thus written: "And the ark rested
in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,
on the mountains of Ararat. And the waters decreased continually
until the eleventh month: on the first day of the
month were the tops of the mountains seen."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> But if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
months were such as we have, then so were the years. And
certainly months of three days each could not have a twenty-seventh
day. Or if every measure of time was diminished in
proportion, and a thirtieth part of three days was then called
a day, then that great deluge, which is recorded to have lasted
forty days and forty nights, was really over in less than four
of our days. Who can away with such foolishness and absurdity?
Far be this error from us,&mdash;an error which seeks to
build up our faith in the divine Scriptures on false conjecture,
only to demolish our faith at another point. It is plain that
the day then was what it now is, a space of four-and-twenty
hours, determined by the lapse of day and night; the month
then equal to the month now, which is defined by the rise
and completion of one moon; the year then equal to the year
now, which is completed by twelve lunar months, with the
addition of five days and a-fourth to adjust it with the course
of the sun. It was a year of this length which was reckoned
the six hundredth of Noah's life; and in the second month,
the twenty-seventh day of the month, the flood began,&mdash;a
flood which, as is recorded, was caused by heavy rains continuing
for forty days, which days had not only two hours
and a little more, but four-and-twenty hours, completing a
night and a day. And consequently those antediluvians lived
more than 900 years, which were years as long as those
which afterwards Abraham lived 175 of, and after him his
son Isaac 180, and his son Jacob nearly 150, and some time
after, Moses 120, and men now seventy or eighty, or not
much longer, of which years it is said, "their strength is
labour and sorrow."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>But that discrepancy of numbers which is found to exist
between our own and the Hebrew text does not touch the
longevity of the ancients; and if there is any diversity so
great that both versions cannot be true, we must take our
ideas of the real facts from that text out of which our own
version has been translated. However, though any one who
pleases has it in his power to correct this version, yet it is
not unimportant to observe that no one has presumed to
emend the Septuagint from the Hebrew text in the many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
places where they seem to disagree. For this difference has
not been reckoned a falsification; and for my own part I am
persuaded it ought not to be reckoned so. But where the
difference is not a mere copyist's error, and where the sense is
agreeable to truth and illustrative of truth, we must believe
that the divine Spirit prompted them to give a varying version,
not in their function of translators, but in the liberty of prophesying.
And therefore we find that the apostles justly
sanction the Septuagint, by quoting it as well as the Hebrew
when they adduce proofs from the Scriptures. But as I have
promised to treat this subject more carefully, if God help me,
in a more fitting place, I will now go on with the matter in
hand. For there can be no doubt that, the lives of men being
so long, the first-born of the first man could have built a city,&mdash;a
city, however, which was earthly, and not that which is
called the city of God, to describe which we have taken in
hand this great work.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>15. <i>Whether it is credible that the men of the primitive age abstained from
sexual intercourse until that date at which it is recorded that they begat
children.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Some one, then, will say, Is it to be believed that a man
who intended to beget children, and had no intention of continence,
abstained from sexual intercourse a hundred years and
more, or even, according to the Hebrew version, only a little
less, say eighty, seventy, or sixty years; or, if he did not
abstain, was unable to beget offspring? This question admits
of two solutions. For either puberty was so much later as the
whole life was longer, or, which seems to me more likely, it
is not the first-born sons that are here mentioned, but those
whose names were required to fill up the series until Noah
was reached, from whom again we see that the succession is
continued to Abraham, and after him down to that point of
time until which it was needful to mark by pedigree the
course of the most glorious city, which sojourns as a stranger
in this world, and seeks the heavenly country. That which
is undeniable is that Cain was the first who was born of man
and woman. For had he not been the first who was added
by birth to the two unborn persons, Adam could not have said
what he is recorded to have said, "I have gotten a man by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> He was followed by Abel, whom the elder
brother slew, and who was the first to show, by a kind of
foreshadowing of the sojourning city of God, what iniquitous
persecutions that city would suffer at the hands of wicked
and, as it were, earth-born men, who love their earthly origin,
and delight in the earthly happiness of the earthly city. But
how old Adam was when he begat these sons does not appear.
After this the generations diverge, the one branch deriving
from Cain, the other from him whom Adam begot in the room
of Abel slain by his brother, and whom he called Seth, saying,
as it is written, "For God hath raised me up another seed for
Abel whom Cain slew."<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> These two series of generations
accordingly, the one of Cain, the other of Seth, represent the
two cities in their distinctive ranks, the one the heavenly city,
which sojourns on earth, the other the earthly, which gapes
after earthly joys, and grovels in them as if they were the
only joys. But though eight generations, including Adam, are
registered before the flood, no man of Cain's line has his age
recorded at which the son who succeeded him was begotten.
For the Spirit of God refused to mark the times before the
flood in the generations of the earthly city, but preferred to do
so in the heavenly line, as if it were more worthy of being
remembered. Further, when Seth was born, the age of his
father is mentioned; but already he had begotten other sons,
and who will presume to say that Cain and Abel were the
only ones previously begotten? For it does not follow that
they alone had been begotten of Adam, because they alone
were named in order to continue the series of generations
which it was desirable to mention. For though the names of
all the rest are buried in silence, yet it is said that Adam
begot sons and daughters; and who that cares to be free from
the charge of temerity will dare to say how many his offspring
numbered? It was possible enough that Adam was divinely
prompted to say, after Seth was born, "For God hath raised
up to me another seed for Abel," because that son was to be
capable of representing Abel's holiness, not because he was born
first after him in point of time. Then because it is written,
"And Seth lived 205 years," or, according to the Hebrew reading,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
"105 years, and begat Enos,"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> who but a rash man could
affirm that this was his first-born? Will any man do so to
excite our wonder, and cause us to inquire how for so many
years he remained free from sexual intercourse, though without
any purpose of continuing so, or how, if he did not abstain, he
yet had no children? Will any man do so when it is written
of him, "And he begat sons and daughters, and all the days
of Seth were 912 years, and he died?"<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> And similarly regarding
those whose years are afterwards mentioned, it is not
disguised that they begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p>Consequently it does not at all appear whether he who is
named as the son was himself the first begotten. Nay, since
it is incredible that those fathers were either so long in attaining
puberty, or could not get wives, or could not impregnate
them, it is also incredible that those sons were their first-born.
But as the writer of the sacred history designed to descend by
well-marked intervals through a series of generations to the
birth and life of Noah, in whose time the flood occurred, he
mentioned not those sons who were first begotten, but those
by whom the succession was handed down.</p>

<p>Let me make this clearer by here inserting an example, in
regard to which no one can have any doubt that what I am
asserting is true. The evangelist Matthew, where he designs
to commit to our memories the generation of the Lord's flesh
by a series of parents, beginning from Abraham and intending
to reach David, says, "Abraham begat Isaac;"<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> why did he
not say Ishmael, whom he first begat? Then "Isaac begat
Jacob;" why did he not say Esau, who was the first-born?
Simply because these sons would not have helped him to
reach David. Then follows, "And Jacob begat Judah and
his brethren:" was Judah the first begotten? "Judah," he
says, "begat Pharez and Zara;" yet neither were these twins
the first-born of Judah, but before them he had begotten
three other sons. And so in the order of the generations he
retained those by whom he might reach David, so as to proceed
onwards to the end he had in view. And from this we
may understand that the antediluvians who are mentioned
were not the first-born, but those through whom the order of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
the succeeding generations might be carried on to the patriarch
Noah. We need not, therefore, weary ourselves with discussing
the needless and obscure question as to their lateness of reaching
puberty.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of marriage between blood-relations, in regard to which the present law
could not bind the men of the earliest ages.</i></p>

<p>As, therefore, the human race, subsequently to the first
marriage of the man who was made of dust, and his wife who
was made out of his side, required the union of males and
females in order that it might multiply, and as there were no
human beings except those who had been born of these two,
men took their sisters for wives,&mdash;an act which was as certainly
dictated by necessity in these ancient days as afterwards it
was condemned by the prohibitions of religion. For it is
very reasonable and just that men, among whom concord is
honourable and useful, should be bound together by various
relationships; and that one man should not himself sustain
many relationships, but that the various relationships should
be distributed among several, and should thus serve to bind
together the greatest number in the same social interests.
"Father" and "father-in-law" are the names of two relationships.
When, therefore, a man has one person for his
father, another for his father-in-law, friendship extends itself
to a larger number. But Adam in his single person was
obliged to hold both relations to his sons and daughters, for
brothers and sisters were united in marriage. So too Eve
his wife was both mother and mother-in-law to her children
of both sexes; while, had there been two women, one the
mother, the other the mother-in-law, the family affection
would have had a wider field. Then the sister herself by
becoming a wife sustained in her single person two relationships,
which, had they been distributed among individuals, one
being sister, and another being wife, the family tie would have
embraced a greater number of persons. But there was then
no material for effecting this, since there were no human
beings but the brothers and sisters born of those two first
parents. Therefore, when an abundant population made it
possible, men ought to choose for wives women who were not
already their sisters; for not only would there then be no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
necessity for marrying sisters, but, were it done, it would be
most abominable. For if the grandchildren of the first pair,
being now able to choose their cousins for wives, married
their sisters, then it would no longer be only two but three
relationships that were held by one man, while each of these
relationships ought to have been held by a separate individual,
so as to bind together by family affection a larger number.
For one man would in that case be both father, and father-in-law,
and uncle<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> to his own children (brother and sister now
man and wife); and his wife would be mother, aunt, and
mother-in-law to them; and they themselves would be not
only brother and sister, and man and wife, but cousins also,
being the children of brother and sister. Now, all these
relationships, which combined three men into one, would have
embraced nine persons had each relationship been held by
one individual, so that a man had one person for his sister,
another his wife, another his cousin, another his father, another
his uncle, another his father-in-law, another his mother, another
his aunt, another his mother-in-law; and thus the social bond
would not have been tightened to bind a few, but loosened to
embrace a larger number of relations.</p>

<p>And we see that, since the human race has increased and
multiplied, this is so strictly observed even among the profane
worshippers of many and false gods, that though their
laws perversely allow a brother to marry his sister,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> yet custom,
with a finer morality, prefers to forego this licence; and
though it was quite allowable in the earliest ages of the
human race to marry one's sister, it is now abhorred as a
thing which no circumstances could justify. For custom has
very great power either to attract or to shock human feeling.
And in this matter, while it restrains concupiscence within
due bounds, the man who neglects and disobeys it is justly
branded as abominable. For if it is iniquitous to plough
beyond our own boundaries through the greed of gain, is it
not much more iniquitous to transgress the recognised boundaries
of morals through sexual lust? And with regard to
marriage in the next degree of consanguinity, marriage between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
cousins, we have observed that in our own time the
customary morality has prevented this from being frequent,
though the law allows it. It was not prohibited by divine
law, nor as yet had human law prohibited it; nevertheless,
though legitimate, people shrank from it, because it lay so
close to what was illegitimate, and in marrying a cousin
seemed almost to marry a sister,&mdash;for cousins are so closely
related that they are called brothers and sisters,<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> and are
almost really so. But the ancient fathers, fearing that near
relationship might gradually in the course of generations
diverge, and become distant relationship, or cease to be relationship
at all, religiously endeavoured to limit it by the
bond of marriage before it became distant, and thus, as it
were, to call it back when it was escaping them. And on
this account, even when the world was full of people, though
they did not choose wives from among their sisters or half-sisters,
yet they preferred them to be of the same stock as
themselves. But who doubts that the modern prohibition of
the marriage even of cousins is the more seemly regulation,&mdash;not
merely on account of the reason we have been urging,
the multiplying of relationships, so that one person might not
absorb two, which might be distributed to two persons, and
so increase the number of people bound together as a family,
but also because there is in human nature I know not what
natural and praiseworthy shamefacedness which restrains us
from desiring that connection which, though for propagation,
is yet lustful, and which even conjugal modesty blushes over,
with any one to whom consanguinity bids us render respect?</p>

<p>The sexual intercourse of man and woman, then, is in the
case of mortals a kind of seed-bed of the city; but while
the earthly city needs for its population only generation, the
heavenly needs also regeneration to rid it of the taint of
generation. Whether before the deluge there was any bodily
or visible sign of regeneration, such as was afterwards enjoined
upon Abraham when he was circumcised, or what kind of
sign it was, the sacred history does not inform us. But it
does inform us that even these earliest of mankind sacrificed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
to God, as appeared also in the case of the two first brothers;
Noah, too, is said to have offered sacrifices to God when he
had come forth from the ark after the deluge. And concerning
this subject we have already said in the foregoing books
that the devils arrogate to themselves divinity, and require
sacrifice that they may be esteemed gods, and delight in these
honours on no other account than this, because they know
that true sacrifice is due to the true God.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of the two fathers and leaders who sprang from one progenitor.</i></p>

<p>Since, then, Adam was the father of both lines,&mdash;the father,
that is to say, both of the line which belonged to the earthly,
and of that which belonged to the heavenly city,&mdash;when Abel
was slain, and by his death exhibited a marvellous mystery,
there were henceforth two lines proceeding from two fathers,
Cain and Seth, and in those sons of theirs, whom it behoved
to register, the tokens of these two cities began to appear
more distinctly. For Cain begat Enoch, in whose name he
built a city, an earthly one, which was not from home in this
world, but rested satisfied with its temporal peace and happiness.
Cain, too, means "possession;" wherefore at his birth
either his father or mother said, "I have gotten a man through
God." Then Enoch means "dedication;" for the earthly city
is dedicated in this world in which it is built, for in this
world it finds the end towards which it aims and aspires.
Further, Seth signifies "resurrection," and Enos his son signifies
"man," not as Adam, which also signifies man but is
used in Hebrew indifferently for man and woman, as it is
written, "Male and female created He them, and blessed them,
and called their name Adam,"<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> leaving no room to doubt that
though the woman was distinctively called Eve, yet the name
Adam, meaning man, was common to both. But Enos means
man in so restricted a sense, that Hebrew linguists tell us it
cannot be applied to woman: it is the equivalent of the
"child of the resurrection," when they neither marry nor are
given in marriage.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> For there shall be no generation in that
place to which regeneration shall have brought us. Wherefore
I think it not immaterial to observe that in those generations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
which are propagated from him who is called Seth,
although daughters as well as sons are said to have been
begotten, no woman is expressly registered by name; but in
those which sprang from Cain at the very termination to
which the line runs, the last person named as begotten is a
woman. For we read, "Methusael begat Lamech. And
Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was
Adah, and the name of the other Zillah. And Adah bare
Jabal: he was the father of the shepherds that dwell in tents.
And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all
such as handle the harp and organ. And Zillah, she also
bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every artificer in brass and
iron: and the sister of Tubal-Cain was Naamah."<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> Here terminate
all the generations of Cain, being eight in number,
including Adam,&mdash;to wit, seven from Adam to Lamech, who
married two wives, and whose children, among whom a woman
also is named, form the eighth generation. Whereby it is
elegantly signified that the earthly city shall to its termination
have carnal generations proceeding from the intercourse
of males and females. And therefore the wives themselves
of the man who is the last named father of Cain's line are
registered in their own names,&mdash;a practice nowhere followed
before the deluge save in Eve's case. Now as Cain, signifying
possession, the founder of the earthly city, and his son
Enoch, meaning dedication, in whose name it was founded,
indicate that this city is earthly both in its beginning and in
its end,&mdash;a city in which nothing more is hoped for than can
be seen in this world,&mdash;so Seth, meaning resurrection, and
being the father of generations registered apart from the
others, we must consider what this sacred history says of
his son.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>The significance of Abel, Seth, and Enos to Christ and His body
the Church.</i></p>

<p>"And to Seth," it is said, "there was born a son, and he
called his name Enos: he hoped to call on the name of the
Lord God."<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> Here we have a loud testimony to the truth.
Man, then, the son of the resurrection, lives in hope: he
lives in hope as long as the city of God, which is begotten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
by faith in the resurrection, sojourns in this world. For in
these two men, Abel, signifying "grief," and his brother Seth,
signifying "resurrection," the death of Christ and His life from
the dead are prefigured. And by faith in these is begotten
in this world the city of God, that is to say, the man who has
hoped to call on the name of the Lord. "For by hope," says
the apostle, "we are saved: but hope that is seen is not
hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with
patience wait for it."<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> Who can avoid referring this to a
profound mystery? For did not Abel hope to call upon the
name of the Lord God when his sacrifice is mentioned in
Scripture as having been accepted by God? Did not Seth
himself hope to call on the name of the Lord God, of whom
it was said, "For God hath appointed me another seed instead
of Abel?" Why then is this which is found to be
common to all the godly specially attributed to Enos, unless
because it was fit that in him, who is mentioned as the
first-born of the father of those generations which were separated
to the better part of the heavenly city, there should be
a type of the man, or society of men, who live not according
to man in contentment with earthly felicity, but according to
God in hope of everlasting felicity? And it was not said, "He
hoped in the Lord God," nor "He called on the name of the
Lord God," but "He hoped to call on the name of the Lord
God." And what does this "hoped to call" mean, unless it
is a prophecy that a people should arise who, according to the
election of grace, would call on the name of the Lord God?
It is this which has been said by another prophet, and which
the apostle interprets of the people who belong to the grace
of God: "And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the
name of the Lord shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> For these two expressions,
"And he called his name Enos, which means man," and
"He hoped to call on the name of the Lord God," are sufficient
proof that man ought not to rest his hopes in himself;
as it is elsewhere written, "Cursed is the man that trusteth
in man."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Consequently no one ought to trust in himself
that he shall become a citizen of that other city which is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
dedicated in the name of Cain's son in this present time, that
is to say, in the fleeting course of this mortal world, but in
the immortality of perpetual blessedness.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>The significance of Enoch's translation.</i></p>

<p>For that line also of which Seth is the father has the
name "Dedication" in the seventh generation from Adam,
counting Adam. For the seventh from him is Enoch, that
is, Dedication. But this is that man who was translated
because he pleased God, and who held in the order of the
generations a remarkable place, being the seventh from Adam,
a number signalized by the consecration of the Sabbath. But,
counting from the diverging point of the two lines, or from
Seth, he was the sixth. Now it was on the sixth day God
made man, and consummated His works. But the translation
of Enoch prefigured our deferred dedication; for though
it is indeed already accomplished in Christ our Head, who
so rose again that He shall die no more, and who was Himself
also translated, yet there remains another dedication of
the whole house, of which Christ Himself is the foundation,
and this dedication is deferred till the end, when all shall
rise again to die no more. And whether it is the house of
God, or the temple of God, or the city of God, that is said to
be dedicated, it is all the same, and equally in accordance with
the usage of the Latin language. For Virgil himself calls the
city of widest empire "the house of Assaracus,"<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> meaning the
Romans, who were descended through the Trojans from Assaracus.
He also calls them the house of √Üneas, because
Rome was built by those Trojans who had come to Italy
under √Üneas.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> For that poet imitated the sacred writings,
in which the Hebrew nation, though so numerous, is called
the house of Jacob.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>20. <i>How it is that Cain's line terminates in the eighth generation, while Noah,
though descended from the same father, Adam, is found to be the tenth
from him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Some one will say, If the writer of this history intended,
in enumerating the generations from Adam through his son
Seth, to descend through them to Noah, in whose time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
deluge occurred, and from him again to trace the connected
generations down to Abraham, with whom Matthew begins
the pedigree of Christ the eternal King of the city of God,
what did he intend by enumerating the generations from Cain,
and to what terminus did he mean to trace them? We
reply, To the deluge, by which the whole stock of the earthly
city was destroyed, but repaired by the sons of Noah. For
the earthly city and community of men who live after the
flesh will never fail until the end of this world, of which our
Lord says, "The children of this world generate, and are generated."<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
But the city of God, which sojourns in this world,
is conducted by regeneration to the world to come, of which
the children neither generate nor are generated. In this
world generation is common to both cities; though even now
the city of God has many thousand citizens who abstain from
the act of generation; yet the other city also has some citizens
who imitate these, though erroneously. For to that city belong
also those who have erred from the faith, and introduced
divers heresies; for they live according to man, not according
to God. And the Indian gymnosophists, who are said to
philosophize in the solitudes of India in a state of nudity, are
its citizens; and they abstain from marriage. For continence
is not a good thing, except when it is practised in the faith of
the highest good, that is, God. Yet no one is found to have
practised it before the deluge; for indeed even Enoch himself,
the seventh from Adam, who is said to have been translated
without dying, begat sons and daughters before he was translated,
and among these was Methuselah, by whom the succession
of the recorded generations is maintained.</p>

<p>Why, then, is so small a number of Cain's generations
registered, if it was proper to trace them to the deluge, and
if there was no such delay of the date of puberty as to preclude
the hope of offspring for a hundred or more years? For
if the author of this book had not in view some one to whom
he might rigidly trace the series of generations, as he designed
in those which sprang from Seth's seed to descend to Noah,
and thence to start again by a rigid order, what need was
there of omitting the first-born sons for the sake of descending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
to Lamech, in whose sons that line terminates,&mdash;that is
to say, in the eighth generation from Adam, or the seventh
from Cain,&mdash;as if from this point he had wished to pass on to
another series, by which he might reach either the Israelitish
people, among whom the earthly Jerusalem presented a prophetic
figure of the heavenly city, or to Jesus Christ, "according
to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed for ever,"<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> the
Maker and Ruler of the heavenly city? What, I say, was the
need of this, seeing that the whole of Cain's posterity were
destroyed in the deluge? From this it is manifest that they
are the first-born sons who are registered in this genealogy.
Why, then, are there so few of them? Their numbers in the
period before the deluge must have been greater, if the date
of puberty bore no proportion to their longevity, and they had
children before they were a hundred years old. For supposing
they were on an average thirty years old when they began to
beget children, then, as there are eight generations, including
Adam and Lamech's children, 8 times 30 gives 240 years;
did they then produce no more children in all the rest of the
time before the deluge? With what intention, then, did he
who wrote this record make no mention of subsequent generations?
For from Adam to the deluge there are reckoned,
according to our copies of Scripture, 2262 years,<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> and according
to the Hebrew text, 1656 years. Supposing, then, the
smaller number to be the true one, and subtracting from
1656 years 240, is it credible that during the remaining
1400 and odd years until the deluge the posterity of Cain
begat no children?</p>

<p>But let any one who is moved by this call to mind that
when I discussed the question, how it is credible that those
primitive men could abstain for so many years from begetting
children, two modes of solution were found,&mdash;either a puberty
late in proportion to their longevity, or that the sons registered
in the genealogies were not the first-born, but those through
whom the author of the book intended to reach the point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
aimed at, as he intended to reach Noah by the generations of
Seth. So that, if in the generations of Cain there occurs no
one whom the writer could make it his object to reach by
omitting the first-borns and inserting those who would serve
such a purpose, then we must have recourse to the supposition
of late puberty, and say that only at some age beyond a
hundred years they became capable of begetting children, so
that the order of the generations ran through the first-borns,
and filled up even the whole period before the deluge, long
though it was. It is, however, possible that, for some more
secret reason which escapes me, this city, which we say is
earthly, is exhibited in all its generations down to Lamech
and his sons, and that then the writer withholds from recording
the rest which may have existed before the deluge. And
without supposing so late a puberty in these men, there might
be another reason for tracing the generations by sons who were
not first-borns, viz. that the same city which Cain built, and
named after his son Enoch, may have had a widely extended
dominion and many kings, not reigning simultaneously, but
successively, the reigning king begetting always his successor.
Cain himself would be the first of these kings; his son
Enoch, in whose name the city in which he reigned was built,
would be the second; the third Irad, whom Enoch begat;
the fourth Mehujael, whom Irad begat; the fifth Methusael,
whom Mehujael begat; the sixth Lamech, whom Methusael
begat, and who is the seventh from Adam through Cain.
But it was not necessary that the first-born should succeed
their fathers in the kingdom, but those would succeed who
were recommended by the possession of some virtue useful to
the earthly city, or who were chosen by lot, or the son who
was best liked by his father would succeed by a kind of
hereditary right to the throne. And the deluge may have
happened during the lifetime and reign of Lamech, and may
have destroyed him along with all other men, save those who
were in the ark. For we cannot be surprised that, during so
long a period from Adam to the deluge, and with the ages of
individuals varying as they did, there should not be an equal
number of generations in both lines, but seven in Cain's, and
ten in Seth's; for as I have already said, Lamech is the seventh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
from Adam, Noah the tenth; and in Lamech's case not one
son only is registered, as in the former instances, but more,
because it was uncertain which of them would have succeeded
when he died, if there had intervened any time to reign
between his death and the deluge.</p>

<p>But in whatever manner the generations of Cain's line are
traced downwards, whether it be by first-born sons or by the
heirs to the throne, it seems to me that I must by no means
omit to notice that, when Lamech had been set down as the
seventh from Adam, there were named, in addition, as many
of his children as made up this number to eleven, which is
the number signifying sin; for three sons and one daughter
are added. The wives of Lamech have another signification,
different from that which I am now pressing. For at present
I am speaking of the children, and not of those by whom the
children were begotten. Since, then, the law is symbolized
by the number ten,&mdash;whence that memorable Decalogue,&mdash;there
is no doubt that the number eleven, which goes beyond<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
ten, symbolizes the transgression of the law, and consequently
sin. For this reason, eleven veils of goat's skin were ordered
to be hung in the tabernacle of the testimony, which served
in the wanderings of God's people as an ambulatory temple.
And in that haircloth there was a reminder of sins, because
the goats were to be set on the left hand of the Judge; and
therefore, when we confess our sins, we prostrate ourselves in
haircloth, as if we were saying what is written in the psalm,
"My sin is ever before me."<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> The progeny of Adam, then,
by Cain the murderer, is completed in the number eleven,
which symbolizes sin; and this number itself is made up by
a woman, as it was by the same sex that beginning was made
of sin by which we all die. And it was committed that the
pleasure of the flesh, which resists the spirit, might follow;
and so Naamah, the daughter of Lamech, means "pleasure."
But from Adam to Noah, in the line of Seth, there are ten
generations. And to Noah three sons are added, of whom,
while one fell into sin, two were blessed by their father; so
that, if you deduct the reprobate and add the gracious sons to
the number, you get twelve,&mdash;a number signalized in the case<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
of the patriarchs and of the apostles, and made up of the parts
of the number seven multiplied into one another,&mdash;for three
times four, or four times three, give twelve. These things
being so, I see that I must consider and mention how these
two lines, which by their separate genealogies depict the two
cities, one of earth-born, the other of regenerated persons,
became afterwards so mixed and confused, that the whole
human race, with the exception of eight persons, deserved to
perish in the deluge.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>21. <i>Why it is that, as soon as Cain's son Enoch has been named, the genealogy
is forthwith continued as far as the deluge, while after the mention of
Enos, Seth's son, the narrative returns again to the creation of man.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>We must first see why, in the enumeration of Cain's posterity,
after Enoch, in whose name the city was built, has
been first of all mentioned, the rest are at once enumerated
down to that terminus of which I have spoken, and at which
that race and the whole line was destroyed in the deluge;
while, after Enos the son of Seth has been mentioned, the
rest are not at once named down to the deluge, but a clause
is inserted to the following effect: "This is the book of the
generations of Adam. In the day that God created man, in
the likeness of God made He him; male and female created
He them; and blessed them, and called their name Adam, in
the day when they were created."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> This seems to me to be
inserted for this purpose, that here again the reckoning of the
times may start from Adam himself,&mdash;a purpose which the
writer had not in view in speaking of the earthly city, as if
God mentioned it, but did not take account of its duration.
But why does he return to this recapitulation after mentioning
the son of Seth, the man who hoped to call on the name
of the Lord God, unless because it was fit thus to present
these two cities, the one beginning with a murderer and
ending in a murderer (for Lamech, too, acknowledges to his
two wives that he had committed murder), the other built
up by him who hoped to call upon the name of the Lord
God? For the highest and complete terrestrial duty of the
city of God, which is a stranger in this world, is that which
was exemplified in the individual who was begotten by him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
who typified the resurrection of the murdered Abel. That
one man is the unity of the whole heavenly city, not yet
indeed complete, but to be completed, as this prophetic figure
foreshows. The son of Cain, therefore, that is, the son of
possession (and of what but an earthly possession?), may have
a name in the earthly city which was built in his name. It
is of such the Psalmist says, "They call their lands after their
own names."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> Wherefore they incur what is written in another
psalm: "Thou, O Lord, in Thy city wilt despise their image."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
But as for the son of Seth, the son of the resurrection, let him
hope to call on the name of the Lord God. For he prefigures
that society of men which says, "But I am like a green olive-tree
in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of
God."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> But let him not seek the empty honours of a famous
name upon earth, for "Blessed is the man that maketh the
name of the Lord his trust, and respecteth not vanities nor
lying follies."<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> After having presented the two cities, the one
founded in the material good of this world, the other in hope
in God, but both starting from a common gate opened in Adam
into this mortal state, and both running on and running out
to their proper and merited ends, Scripture begins to reckon
the times, and in this reckoning includes other generations,
making a recapitulation from Adam, out of whose condemned
seed, as out of one mass handed over to merited damnation,
God made some vessels of wrath to dishonour and others
vessels of mercy to honour; in punishment rendering to the
former what is due, in grace giving to the latter what is not
due: in order that by the very comparison of itself with the
vessels of wrath, the heavenly city, which sojourns on earth,
may learn not to put confidence in the liberty of its own will,
but may hope to call on the name of the Lord God. For will,
being a nature which was made good by the good God, but
mutable by the immutable, because it was made out of nothing,
can both decline from good to do evil, which takes place when
it freely chooses, and can also escape the evil and do good,
which takes place only by divine assistance.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>22. <i>Of the fall of the sons of God who were captivated by the daughters of men,
whereby all, with the exception of eight persons, deservedly perished in
the deluge.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>When the human race, in the exercise of this freedom of
will, increased and advanced, there arose a mixture and confusion
of the two cities by their participation in a common
iniquity. And this calamity, as well as the first, was occasioned
by woman, though not in the same way; for these
women were not themselves betrayed, neither did they persuade
the men to sin, but having belonged to the earthly city
and society of the earthly, they had been of corrupt manners
from the first, and were loved for their bodily beauty by the
sons of God, or the citizens of the other city which sojourns
in this world. Beauty is indeed a good gift of God; but
that the good may not think it a great good, God dispenses it
even to the wicked. And thus, when the good that is great
and proper to the good was abandoned by the sons of God,
they fell to a paltry good which is not peculiar to the good,
but common to the good and the evil; and when they were
captivated by the daughters of men, they adopted the manners
of the earthly to win them as their brides, and forsook the
godly ways they had followed in their own holy society. And
thus beauty, which is indeed God's handiwork, but only a
temporal, carnal, and lower kind of good, is not fitly loved in
preference to God, the eternal, spiritual, and unchangeable
good. When the miser prefers his gold to justice, it is through
no fault of the gold, but of the man; and so with every
created thing. For though it be good, it may be loved with
an evil as well as with a good love: it is loved rightly when
it is loved ordinately; evilly, when inordinately. It is this
which some one has briefly said in these verses in praise of
the Creator:<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> "These are Thine, they are good, because Thou
art good who didst create them. There is in them nothing
of ours, unless the sin we commit when we forget the order
of things, and instead of Thee love that which Thou hast
made."</p>

<p>But if the Creator is truly loved, that is, if He Himself is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
loved and not another thing in His stead, He cannot be
evilly loved; for love itself is to be ordinately loved, because
we do well to love that which, when we love it, makes us live
well and virtuously. So that it seems to me that it is a brief
but true definition of virtue to say, it is the order of love;
and on this account, in the Canticles, the bride of Christ, the
city of God, sings, "Order love within me."<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> It was the
order of this love, then, this charity or attachment, which the
sons of God disturbed when they forsook God, and were enamoured
of the daughters of men.<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> And by these two names
(sons of God and daughters of men) the two cities are sufficiently
distinguished. For though the former were by nature
children of men, they had come into possession of another
name by grace. For in the same Scripture in which the sons
of God are said to have loved the daughters of men, they are
also called angels of God; whence many suppose that they
were not men but angels.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>23. <i>Whether we are to believe that angels, who are of a spiritual substance, fell in
love with the beauty of women, and sought them in marriage, and that
from this connection giants were born.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In the third book of this work (c. 5) we made a passing
reference to this question, but did not decide whether angels,
inasmuch as they are spirits, could have bodily intercourse with
women. For it is written, "Who maketh His angels spirits,"<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
that is, He makes those who are by nature spirits His angels
by appointing them to the duty of bearing His messages.
For the Greek word &#7940;&#947;&#947;&#949;&#955;&#959;&#962;, which in Latin appears as
"angelus," means a messenger. But whether the Psalmist
speaks of their bodies when he adds, "and His ministers a
flaming fire," or means that God's ministers ought to blaze
with love as with a spiritual fire, is doubtful. However, the
same trustworthy Scripture testifies that angels have appeared
to men in such bodies as could not only be seen, but also
touched. There is, too, a very general rumour, which many
have verified by their own experience, or which trustworthy
persons who have heard the experience of others corroborate,
that sylvans and fauns, who are commonly called "incubi,"
had often made wicked assaults upon women, and satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
their lust upon them; and that certain devils, called Duses
by the Gauls, are constantly attempting and effecting this impurity
is so generally affirmed, that it were impudent to deny
it.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> From these assertions, indeed, I dare not determine
whether there be some spirits embodied in an aerial substance
(for this element, even when agitated by a fan, is sensibly felt
by the body), and who are capable of lust and of mingling
sensibly with women; but certainly I could by no means
believe that God's holy angels could at that time have so
fallen, nor can I think that it is of them the Apostle Peter
said, "For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast
them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness,
to be reserved unto judgment."<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> I think he rather speaks of
those who first apostatized from God, along with their chief
the devil, who enviously deceived the first man under the form
of a serpent. But the same holy Scripture affords the most
ample testimony that even godly men have been called angels;
for of John it is written: "Behold, I send my messenger (angel)
before Thy face, who shall prepare Thy way."<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> And the
prophet Malachi, by a peculiar grace specially communicated
to him, was called an angel.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p>But some are moved by the fact that we have read that the
fruit of the connection between those who are called angels of
God and the women they loved were not men like our own
breed, but giants; just as if there were not born even in our
own time (as I have mentioned above) men of much greater
size than the ordinary stature. Was there not at Rome a few
years ago, when the destruction of the city now accomplished
by the Goths was drawing near, a woman, with her father and
mother, who by her gigantic size overtopped all others? Surprising
crowds from all quarters came to see her, and that
which struck them most was the circumstance that neither
of her parents were quite up to the tallest ordinary stature.
Giants therefore might well be born, even before the sons of
God, who are also called angels of God, formed a connection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
with the daughters of men, or of those living according to men,
that is to say, before the sons of Seth formed a connection
with the daughters of Cain. For thus speaks even the
canonical Scripture itself in the book in which we read of
this; its words are: "And it came to pass, when men began
to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born
unto them, that the sons of God saw the daughters of men
that they were fair [good]; and they took them wives of all
which they chose. And the Lord God said, My Spirit shall
not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his
days shall be an hundred and twenty years. There were
giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when
the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they
bare children to them, the same became the giants, men of
renown."<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> These words of the divine book sufficiently indicate
that already there were giants in the earth in those days, in
which the sons of God took wives of the children of men,
when they loved them because they were good, that is, fair.
For it is the custom of this Scripture to call those who are
beautiful in appearance "good." But after this connection
had been formed, then too were giants born. For the words
are: "There were giants in the earth in those days, <i>and also
after that</i>, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters
of men." Therefore there were giants both before, "in those
days," and "also after that." And the words, "they bare
children to them," show plainly enough that before the sons
of God fell in this fashion they begat children to God, not to
themselves,&mdash;that is to say, not moved by the lust of sexual
intercourse, but discharging the duty of propagation, intending
to produce not a family to gratify their own pride, but citizens
to people the city of God; and to these they as God's angels
would bear the message, that they should place their hope in
God, like him who was born of Seth the son of resurrection,
and who hoped to call on the name of the Lord God, in which
hope they and their offspring would be co-heirs of eternal blessings,
and brethren in the family of which God is the Father.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>
<p>But that those angels were not angels in the sense of not
being men, as some suppose, Scripture itself decides, which
unambiguously declares that they were men. For when it had
first been stated that "the angels of God saw the daughters of
men that they were fair, and they took them wives of all
which they chose," it was immediately added, "And the Lord
God said, My Spirit shall not always strive with these men, for
that they also are flesh." For by the Spirit of God they had
been made angels of God, and sons of God; but declining
towards lower things, they are called men, a name of nature,
not of grace; and they are called flesh, as deserters of the
Spirit, and by their desertion deserted [by Him]. The Septuagint
indeed calls them both angels of God and sons of
God, though all the copies do not show this, some having
only the name "sons of God." And Aquila, whom the Jews
prefer to the other interpreters,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> has translated neither angels
of God nor sons of God, but sons of gods. But both are
correct. For they were both sons of God, and thus brothers
of their own fathers, who were children of the same God; and
they were sons of gods, because begotten by gods, together
with whom they themselves also were gods, according to that
expression of the psalm: "I have said, Ye are gods, and all of
you are children of the Most High."<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> For the Septuagint
translators are justly believed to have received the Spirit of
prophecy; so that, if they made any alterations under His
authority, and did not adhere to a strict translation, we could
not doubt that this was divinely dictated. However, the
Hebrew word may be said to be ambiguous, and to be susceptible
of either translation, "sons of God," or "sons of
gods."</p>

<p>Let us omit, then, the fables of those scriptures which are
called apocryphal, because their obscure origin was unknown
to the fathers from whom the authority of the true Scriptures
has been transmitted to us by a most certain and well-ascertained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
succession. For though there is some truth in these
apocryphal writings, yet they contain so many false statements,
that they have no canonical authority. We cannot
deny that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, left some divine
writings, for this is asserted by the Apostle Jude in his canonical
epistle. But it is not without reason that these writings
have no place in that canon of Scripture which was preserved
in the temple of the Hebrew people by the diligence of successive
priests; for their antiquity brought them under suspicion,
and it was impossible to ascertain whether these were
his genuine writings, and they were not brought forward as
genuine by the persons who were found to have carefully preserved
the canonical books by a successive transmission. So
that the writings which are produced under his name, and
which contain these fables about the giants, saying that their
fathers were not men, are properly judged by prudent men to
be not genuine; just as many writings are produced by
heretics under the names both of other prophets, and, more
recently, under the names of the apostles, all of which, after
careful examination, have been set apart from canonical authority
under the title of Apocrypha. There is therefore no
doubt that, according to the Hebrew and Christian canonical
Scriptures, there were many giants before the deluge, and that
these were citizens of the earthly society of men, and that the
sons of God, who were according to the flesh the sons of Seth,
sunk into this community when they forsook righteousness.
Nor need we wonder that giants should be born even from
these. For all of their children were not giants; but there
were more then than in the remaining periods since the
deluge. And it pleased the Creator to produce them, that it
might thus be demonstrated that neither beauty, nor yet size
and strength, are of much moment to the wise man, whose
blessedness lies in spiritual and immortal blessings, in far better
and more enduring gifts, in the good things that are the peculiar
property of the good, and are not shared by good and bad
alike. It is this which another prophet confirms when he
says, "These were the giants, famous from the beginning,
that were of so great stature, and so expert in war. Those
did not the Lord choose, neither gave He the way of knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
unto them; but they were destroyed because they had
no wisdom, and perished through their own foolishness."<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>


<p class="center">24. <i>How we are to understand this which the Lord said to those who were
to perish in the flood: "Their days shall be</i> 120 <i>years."</i></p>

<p>But that which God said, "Their days shall be an hundred
and twenty years," is not to be understood as a prediction that
henceforth men should not live longer than 120 years,&mdash;for
even after the deluge we find that they lived more than 500
years,&mdash;but we are to understand that God said this when Noah
had nearly completed his fifth century, that is, had lived 480
years, which Scripture, as it frequently uses the name of the
whole for the largest part, calls 500 years. Now the deluge
came in the 600th year of Noah's life, the second month; and
thus 120 years were predicted as being the remaining span of
those who were doomed, which years being spent, they should
be destroyed by the deluge. And it is not unreasonably
believed that the deluge came as it did, because already there
were not found upon earth any who were not worthy of
sharing a death so manifestly judicial,&mdash;not that a good man,
who must die some time, would be a jot the worse of such a
death after it was past. Nevertheless there died in the deluge
none of those mentioned in the sacred Scripture as descended
from Seth. But here is the divine account of the cause of the
deluge: "The Lord God saw that the wickedness of man was
great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts
of his heart was only evil continually. And it repented<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> the
Lord that He had made man on the earth, and it grieved Him
at His heart. And the Lord said, I will destroy man, whom I
have created, from the face of the earth; both man and beast,
and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air: for I am
angry that I have made them."<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Of the anger of God, which does not inflame His mind, nor disturb His
unchangeable tranquillity.</i></p>

<p>The anger of God is not a disturbing emotion of His mind,
but a judgment by which punishment is inflicted upon sin.
His thought and reconsideration also are the unchangeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
reason which changes things; for He does not, like man,
repent of anything He has done, because in all matters His
decision is as inflexible as His prescience is certain. But if
Scripture were not to use such expressions as the above, it
would not familiarly insinuate itself into the minds of all
classes of men, whom it seeks access to for their good, that it
may alarm the proud, arouse the careless, exercise the inquisitive,
and satisfy the intelligent; and this it could not do, did
it not first stoop, and in a manner descend, to them where they
lie. But its denouncing death on all the animals of earth and
air is a declaration of the vastness of the disaster that was
approaching: not that it threatens destruction to the irrational
animals as if they too had incurred it by sin.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>That the ark which Noah was ordered to make figures in every respect
Christ and the church.</i></p>

<p>Moreover, inasmuch as God commanded Noah, a just man,
and, as the truthful Scripture says, a man perfect in his generation,&mdash;not
indeed with the perfection of the citizens of the
city of God in that immortal condition in which they equal
the angels, but in so far as they can be perfect in their sojourn
in this world,&mdash;inasmuch as God commanded him, I say, to make
an ark, in which he might be rescued from the destruction of
the flood, along with his family, <i>i.e.</i> his wife, sons, and daughters-in-law,
and along with the animals who, in obedience to God's
command, came to him into the ark: is certainly a figure
of the city of God sojourning in this world; that is to say,
of the church, which is rescued by the wood on which hung
the Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> For
even its very dimensions, in length, breadth, and height, represent
the human body in which He came, as it had been foretold.
For the length of the human body, from the crown of
the head to the sole of the foot, is six times its breadth from
side to side, and ten times its depth or thickness, measuring
from back to front: that is to say, if you measure a man as
he lies on his back or on his face, he is six times as long from
head to foot as he is broad from side to side, and ten times as
long as he is high from the ground. And therefore the ark
was made 300 cubits in length, 50 in breadth, and 30 in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
height. And its having a door made in the side of it certainly
signified the wound which was made when the side of
the Crucified was pierced with the spear: for by this those
who come to Him enter; for thence flowed the sacraments by
which those who believe are initiated. And the fact that it
was ordered to be made of squared timbers, signifies the immoveable
steadiness of the life of the saints; for however you
turn a cube, it still stands. And the other peculiarities of
the ark's construction are signs of features of the church.</p>

<p>But we have not now time to pursue this subject; and,
indeed, we have already dwelt upon it in the work we wrote
against Faustus the Manichean, who denies that there is anything
prophesied of Christ in the Hebrew books. It may be
that one man's exposition excels another's, and that ours is
not the best; but all that is said must be referred to this
city of God we speak of, which sojourns in this wicked world
as in a deluge, at least if the expositor would not widely miss
the meaning of the author. For example, the interpretation
I have given in the work against Faustus, of the words, "with
lower, second, and third storeys shalt thou make it," is, that
because the church is gathered out of all nations, it is said to
have two storeys, to represent the two kinds of men,&mdash;the circumcision,
to wit, and the uncircumcision, or, as the apostle
otherwise calls them, Jews and Gentiles; and to have three
storeys, because all the nations were replenished from the
three sons of Noah. Now any one may object to this interpretation,
and may give another which harmonizes with the
rule of faith. For as the ark was to have rooms not only on
the lower, but also on the upper storeys, which were called
"third storeys," that there might be a habitable space on the
third floor from the basement, some one may interpret these
to mean the three graces commended by the apostle,&mdash;faith,
hope, and charity. Or even more suitably they may be supposed
to represent those three harvests in the gospel, thirty-fold,
sixtyfold, an hundredfold,&mdash;chaste marriage dwelling in
the ground floor, chaste widowhood in the upper, and chaste
virginity in the top storey. Or any better interpretation may
be given, so long as the reference to this city is maintained.
And the same statement I would make of all the remaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
particulars in this passage which require exposition, viz. that
although different explanations are given, yet they must all
agree with the one harmonious catholic faith.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>27. <i>Of the ark and the deluge, and that we cannot agree with those who receive
the bare history, but reject the allegorical interpretation, nor with those
who maintain the figurative and not the historical meaning.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Yet no one ought to suppose either that these things were
written for no purpose, or that we should study only the
historical truth, apart from any allegorical meanings; or, on
the contrary, that they are only allegories, and that there were
no such facts at all, or that, whether it be so or no, there
is here no prophecy of the church. For what right-minded
man will contend that books so religiously preserved during
thousands of years, and transmitted by so orderly a succession,
were written without an object, or that only the bare
historical facts are to be considered when we read them?
For, not to mention other instances, if the number of the
animals entailed the construction of an ark of great size,
where was the necessity of sending into it two unclean and
seven clean animals of each species, when both could have
been preserved in equal numbers? Or could not God, who
ordered them to be preserved in order to replenish the race,
restore them in the same way He had created them?</p>

<p>But they who contend that these things never happened,
but are only figures setting forth other things, in the first
place suppose that there could not be a flood so great that the
water should rise fifteen cubits above the highest mountains,
because it is said that clouds cannot rise above the top of
Mount Olympus, because it reaches the sky where there is
none of that thicker atmosphere in which winds, clouds, and
rains have their origin. They do not reflect that the densest
element of all, earth, can exist there; or perhaps they deny
that the top of the mountain is earth. Why, then, do these
measurers and weighers of the elements contend that earth
can be raised to those aerial altitudes, and that water cannot,
while they admit that water is lighter, and liker to ascend
than earth? What reason do they adduce why earth, the
heavier and lower element, has for so many ages scaled to the
tranquil √¶ther, while water, the lighter, and more likely to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
ascend, is not suffered to do the same even for a brief space
of time?</p>

<p>They say, too, that the area of that ark could not contain
so many kinds of animals of both sexes, two of the unclean
and seven of the clean. But they seem to me to reckon only
one area of 300 cubits long and 50 broad, and not to remember
that there was another similar in the storey above, and yet
another as large in the storey above that again; and that there
was consequently an area of 900 cubits by 150. And if we
accept what Origen<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> has with some appropriateness suggested,
that Moses the man of God, being, as it is written, "learned
in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> who delighted in geometry,
may have meant geometrical cubits, of which they say
that one is equal to six of our cubits, then who does not see
what a capacity these dimensions give to the ark? For as to
their objection that an ark of such size could not be built, it
is a very silly calumny; for they are aware that huge cities
have been built, and they should remember that the ark was
an hundred years in building. Or, perhaps, though stone can
adhere to stone when cemented with nothing but lime, so that<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">a wall of several miles may be constructed, yet plank cannot be</span><br />
riveted to plank by mortices, bolts, nails, and pitch-glue, so as
to construct an ark which was not made with curved ribs but
straight timbers, which was not to be launched by its builders
but to be lifted by the natural pressure of the water when it
reached it, and which was to be preserved from shipwreck as
it floated about rather by divine oversight than by human
skill.</p>

<p>As to another customary inquiry of the scrupulous about
the very minute creatures, not only such as mice and lizards,
but also locusts, beetles, flies, fleas, and so forth, whether there
were not in the ark a larger number of them than was determined
by God in His command, those persons who are moved
by this difficulty are to be reminded that the words "every
creeping thing of the earth" only indicate that it was not
needful to preserve in the ark the animals that can live in
the water, whether the fishes that live submerged in it, or the
sea-birds that swim on its surface. Then, when it is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
"male and female," no doubt reference is made to the repairing
of the races, and consequently there was no need for
those creatures being in the ark which are born without the
union of the sexes from inanimate things, or from their corruption;
or if they were in the ark, they might be there as they
commonly are in houses, not in any determinate numbers;
or if it was necessary that there should be a definite number
of all those animals that cannot naturally live in the water,
that so the most sacred mystery which was being enacted
might be bodied forth and perfectly figured in actual realities,
still this was not the care of Noah or his sons, but of God.
For Noah did not catch the animals and put them into the
ark, but gave them entrance as they came seeking it. For
this is the force of the words, "They shall come unto thee,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>&mdash;not,
that is to say, by man's effort, but by God's will. But
certainly we are not required to believe that those which
have no sex also came; for it is expressly and definitely said,
"They shall be male and female."<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> For there are some
animals which are born out of corruption, but yet afterwards
they themselves copulate and produce offspring, as flies; but
others, which have no sex, like bees. Then, as to those animals
which have sex, but without ability to propagate their kind,
like mules and she-mules, it is probable that they were not in
the ark, but that it was counted sufficient to preserve their
parents, to wit, the horse and the ass; and this applies to all
hybrids. Yet, if it was necessary for the completeness of the
mystery, they were there; for even this species has "male
and female."</p>

<p>Another question is commonly raised regarding the food of
the carnivorous animals,&mdash;whether, without transgressing the
command which fixed the number to be preserved, there were
necessarily others included in the ark for their sustenance;
or, as is more probable, there might be some food which was
not flesh, and which yet suited all. For we know how many
animals whose food is flesh eat also vegetable products and
fruits, especially figs and chestnuts. What wonder is it,
therefore, if that wise and just man was instructed by God
what would suit each, so that without flesh he prepared and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
stored provision fit for every species? And what is there
which hunger would not make animals eat? Or what could
not be made sweet and wholesome by God, who, with a
divine facility, might have enabled them to do without food
at all, had it not been requisite to the completeness of so
great a mystery that they should be fed? But none but a
contentious man can suppose that there was no prefiguring of
the church in so manifold and circumstantial a detail. For
the nations have already so filled the church, and are comprehended
in the framework of its unity, the clean and unclean
together, until the appointed end, that this one very
manifest fulfilment leaves no doubt how we should interpret
even those others which are somewhat more obscure, and
which cannot so readily be discerned. And since this is so,
if not even the most audacious will presume to assert that
these things were written without a purpose, or that though the
events really happened they mean nothing, or that they did not
really happen, but are only allegory, or that at all events they
are far from having any figurative reference to the church;
if it has been made out that, on the other hand, we must
rather believe that there was a wise purpose in their being
committed to memory and to writing, and that they did
happen, and have a significance, and that this significance has
a prophetic reference to the church, then this book, having
served this purpose, may now be closed, that we may go on
to trace in the history subsequent to the deluge the courses
of the two cities,&mdash;the earthly, that lives according to men,
and the heavenly, that lives according to God.</p>

<h2><a name="BOOK_SIXTEENTH" id="BOOK_SIXTEENTH">BOOK SIXTEENTH.</a></h2>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>IN THE FORMER PART OF THIS BOOK, FROM THE FIRST TO THE TWELFTH CHAPTER,
THE PROGRESS OF THE TWO CITIES, THE EARTHLY AND THE HEAVENLY,
FROM NOAH TO ABRAHAM, IS EXHIBITED FROM HOLY SCRIPTURE: IN THE
LATTER PART, THE PROGRESS OF THE HEAVENLY ALONE, FROM ABRAHAM
TO THE KINGS OF ISRAEL, IS THE SUBJECT.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>Whether, after the deluge, from Noah to Abraham, any families can be
found who lived according to God.</i></p>

<p>It is difficult to discover from Scripture, whether, after the
deluge, traces of the holy city are continuous, or are so
interrupted by intervening seasons of godlessness, that not a
single worshipper of the one true God was found among
men; because from Noah, who, with his wife, three sons, and
as many daughters-in-law, achieved deliverance in the ark
from the destruction of the deluge, down to Abraham, we do
not find in the canonical books that the piety of any one is
celebrated by express divine testimony, unless it be in the
case of Noah, who commends with a prophetic benediction
his two sons Shem and Japheth, while he beheld and foresaw
what was long afterwards to happen. It was also by this
prophetic spirit that, when his middle son&mdash;that is, the son
who was younger than the first and older than the last born&mdash;had
sinned against him, he cursed him not in his own person,
but in his son's (his own grandson's), in the words, "Cursed
be the lad Canaan; a servant shall he be unto his brethren."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
Now Canaan was born of Ham, who, so far from covering his
sleeping father's nakedness, had divulged it. For the same
reason also he subjoins the blessing on his two other sons, the
oldest and youngest, saying, "Blessed be the Lord God of
Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant. God shall gladden
Japheth, and he shall dwell in the houses of Shem."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
so, too, the planting of the vine by Noah, and his intoxication
by its fruit, and his nakedness while he slept, and the other
things done at that time, and recorded, are all of them pregnant
with prophetic meanings, and veiled in mysteries.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>


<p class="center">2. <i>What was prophetically prefigured in the sons of Noah.</i></p>

<p>The things which then were hidden are now sufficiently
revealed by the actual events which have followed. For who
can carefully and intelligently consider these things without
recognising them accomplished in Christ? Shem, of whom
Christ was born in the flesh, means "named." And what is
of greater name than Christ, the fragrance of whose name is
now everywhere perceived, so that even prophecy sings of it
beforehand, comparing it in the Song of Songs<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> to ointment
poured forth? Is it not also in the houses of Christ, that is,
in the churches, that the "enlargement" of the nations dwells?
For Japheth means "enlargement." And Ham (<i>i.e.</i> hot), who
was the middle son of Noah, and, as it were, separated himself
from both, and remained between them, neither belonging
to the first-fruits of Israel nor to the fulness of the Gentiles,
what does he signify but the tribe of heretics, hot with the
spirit, not of patience, but of impatience, with which the
breasts of heretics are wont to blaze, and with which they
disturb the peace of the saints? But even the heretics yield
an advantage to those that make proficiency, according to the
apostle's saying, "There must also be heresies, that they which
are approved may be made manifest among you."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> Whence,
too, it is elsewhere said, "The son that receives instruction
will be wise, and he uses the foolish as his servant."<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> For
while the hot restlessness of heretics stirs questions about
many articles of the catholic faith, the necessity of defending
them forces us both to investigate them more accurately, to
understand them more clearly, and to proclaim them more
earnestly; and the question mooted by an adversary becomes
the occasion of instruction. However, not only those who
are openly separated from the church, but also all who glory
in the Christian name, and at the same time lead abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
lives, may without absurdity seem to be figured by Noah's
middle son: for the passion of Christ, which was signified
by that man's nakedness, is at once proclaimed by their profession,
and dishonoured by their wicked conduct. Of such,
therefore, it has been said, "By their fruits ye shall know
them."<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> And therefore was Ham cursed in his son, he being,
as it were, his fruit. So, too, this son of his, Canaan, is fitly
interpreted "their movement," which is nothing else than their
work. But Shem and Japheth, that is to say, the circumcision
and uncircumcision, or, as the apostle otherwise calls
them, the Jews and Greeks, but called and justified, having
somehow discovered the nakedness of their father (which
signifies the Saviour's passion), took a garment and laid it
upon their backs, and entered backwards and covered their
father's nakedness, without their seeing what their reverence
hid. For we both honour the passion of Christ as accomplished
for us, and we hate the crime of the Jews who crucified
Him. The garment signifies the sacrament, their backs
the memory of things past: for the church celebrates the
passion of Christ as already accomplished, and no longer
to be looked forward to, now that Japheth already dwells in
the habitations of Shem, and their wicked brother between
them.</p>

<p>But the wicked brother is, in the person of his son (<i>i.e.</i>
his work), the boy, or slave, of his good brothers, when good
men make a skilful use of bad men, either for the exercise of
their patience or for their advancement in wisdom. For the
apostle testifies that there are some who preach Christ from
no pure motives; "but," says he, "whether in pretence or in
truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and
will rejoice."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> For it is Christ Himself who planted the
vine of which the prophet says, "The vine of the Lord of
hosts is the house of Israel;"<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and He drinks of its wine,
whether we thus understand that cup of which He says, "Can
ye drink of the cup that I shall drink of?"<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> and, "Father,
if it be possible, let this cup pass from me,"<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> by which He
obviously means His passion. Or, as wine is the fruit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the vine, we may prefer to understand that from this vine,
that is to say, from the race of Israel, He has assumed flesh
and blood that He might suffer; "and he was drunken," that
is, He suffered; "and was naked," that is, His weakness
appeared in His suffering, as the apostle says, "though He
was crucified through weakness."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> Wherefore the same
apostle says, "The weakness of God is stronger than men;
and the foolishness of God is wiser than men."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> And when
to the expression "he was naked" Scripture adds "in his
house," it elegantly intimates that Jesus was to suffer the
cross and death at the hands of His own household, His own
kith and kin, the Jews. This passion of Christ is only
externally and verbally professed by the reprobate, for what
they profess they do not understand. But the elect hold in
the inner man this so great mystery, and honour inwardly in
the heart this weakness and foolishness of God. And of this
there is a figure in Ham going out to proclaim his father's
nakedness; while Shem and Japheth, to cover or honour it,
went in, that is to say, did it inwardly.</p>

<p>These secrets of divine Scripture we investigate as well as
we can. All will not accept our interpretation with equal
confidence, but all hold it certain that these things were
neither done nor recorded without some foreshadowing of
future events, and that they are to be referred only to Christ
and His church, which is the city of God, proclaimed from
the very beginning of human history by figures which we
now see everywhere accomplished. From the blessing of the
two sons of Noah, and the cursing of the middle son, down
to Abraham, or for more than a thousand years, there is, as
I have said, no mention of any righteous persons who worshipped
God. I do not therefore conclude that there were
none; but it had been tedious to mention every one, and
would have displayed historical accuracy rather than prophetic
foresight. The object of the writer of these sacred books, or
rather of the Spirit of God in him, is not only to record the
past, but to depict the future, so far as it regards the city of
God; for whatever is said of those who are not its citizens,
is given either for her instruction, or as a foil to enhance her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
glory. Yet we are not to suppose that all that is recorded
has some signification; but those things which have no signification
of their own are interwoven for the sake of the things
which are significant. It is only the ploughshare that cleaves
the soil; but to effect this, other parts of the plough are
requisite. It is only the strings in harps and other musical
instruments which produce melodious sounds; but that they
may do so, there are other parts of the instrument which are
not indeed struck by those who sing, but are connected with
the strings which are struck, and produce musical notes. So
in this prophetic history some things are narrated which have
no significance, but are, as it were, the framework to which the
significant things are attached.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Of the generations of the three sons of Noah.</i></p>

<p>We must therefore introduce into this work an explanation
of the generations of the three sons of Noah, in so far as that
may illustrate the progress in time of the two cities. Scripture
first mentions that of the youngest son, who is called Japheth:
he had eight sons,<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> and by two of these sons seven grandchildren,
three by one son, four by the other; in all, fifteen
descendants. Ham, Noah's middle son, had four sons, and
by one of them five grandsons, and by one of these two great-grandsons;
in all, eleven. After enumerating these, Scripture
returns to the first of the sons, and says, "Cush begat Nimrod;
he began to be a giant on the earth. He was a giant hunter
against the Lord God: wherefore they say, As Nimrod the
giant hunter against the Lord. And the beginning of his
kingdom was Babylon, Erech, Accad, and Calneh, in the land
of Shinar. Out of that land went forth Assur, and built
Nineveh, and the city Rehoboth, and Calah, and Resen between
Nineveh and Calah: this was a great city." Now this
Cush, father of the giant Nimrod, is the first-named among
the sons of Ham, to whom five sons and two grandsons are
ascribed. But he either begat this giant after his grandsons
were born, or, which is more credible, Scripture speaks of him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
separately on account of his eminence; for mention is also
made of his kingdom, which began with that magnificent city
Babylon, and the other places, whether cities or districts,
mentioned along with it. But what is recorded of the land
of Shinar which belonged to Nimrod's kingdom, to wit, that
Assur went forth from it and built Nineveh and the other
cities mentioned with it, happened long after; but he takes
occasion to speak of it here on account of the grandeur of
the Assyrian kingdom, which was wonderfully extended by
Ninus son of Belus, and founder of the great city Nineveh,
which was named after him, Nineveh, from Ninus. But
Assur, father of the Assyrian, was not one of the sons of Ham,
Noah's middle son, but is found among the sons of Shem, his
eldest son. Whence it appears that among Shem's offspring
there arose men who afterwards took possession of that giant's
kingdom, and advancing from it, founded other cities, the first
of which was called Nineveh, from Ninus. From him Scripture
returns to Ham's other son, Mizraim; and his sons are
enumerated, not as seven individuals, but as seven nations.
And from the sixth, as if from the sixth son, the race called
the Philistines are said to have sprung; so that there are in
all eight. Then it returns again to Canaan, in whose person
Ham was cursed; and his eleven sons are named. Then the
territories they occupied, and some of the cities, are named.
And thus, if we count sons and grandsons, there are thirty-one
of Ham's descendants registered.</p>

<p>It remains to mention the sons of Shem, Noah's eldest
son; for to him this genealogical narrative gradually ascends
from the youngest. But in the commencement of the record
of Shem's sons there is an obscurity which calls for explanation,
since it is closely connected with the object of our investigation.
For we read, "Unto Shem also, the father of all
the children of Heber, the brother of Japheth the elder, were
children born."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> This is the order of the words: And to
Shem was born Heber, even to himself, that is, to Shem himself
was born Heber, and Shem is the father of all his children.
We are intended to understand that Shem is the patriarch of all
his posterity who were to be mentioned, whether sons, grandsons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
great-grandsons, or descendants at any remove. For
Shem did not beget Heber, who was indeed in the fifth generation
from him. For Shem begat, among other sons, Arphaxad;
Arphaxad begat Cainan, Cainan begat Salah, Salah begat
Heber. And it was with good reason that he was named
first among Shem's offspring, taking precedence even of his
sons, though only a grandchild of the fifth generation; for
from him, as tradition says, the Hebrews derived their name,
though the other etymology which derives the name from
Abraham (as if <i>Abrahews</i>) may possibly be correct. But
there can be little doubt that the former is the right etymology,
and that they were called after Heber, <i>Heberews</i>, and
then, dropping a letter, Hebrews; and so was their language
called Hebrew, which was spoken by none but the people of
Israel among whom was the city of God, mysteriously prefigured
in all the people, and truly present in the saints.
Six of Shem's sons then are first named, then four grandsons
born to one of these sons; then it mentions another son of
Shem, who begat a grandson; and his son, again, or Shem's
great-grandson, was Heber. And Heber begat two sons, and
called the one Peleg, which means "dividing;" and Scripture
subjoins the reason of this name, saying, "for in his days was
the earth divided." What this means will afterwards appear.
Heber's other son begat twelve sons; consequently all Shem's
descendants are twenty-seven. The total number of the progeny
of the three sons of Noah is seventy-three, fifteen by
Japheth, thirty-one by Ham, twenty-seven by Shem. Then
Scripture adds, "These are the sons of Shem, after their
families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations."
And so of the whole number: "These are the families of the
sons of Noah after their generations, in their nations; and
by these were the isles of the nations dispersed through the
earth after the flood." From which we gather that the
seventy-three (or rather, as I shall presently show, seventy-two)
were not individuals, but nations. For in a former passage,
when the sons of Japheth were enumerated, it is said in conclusion,
"By these were the isles of the nations divided in
their lands, every one after his language, in their tribes, and
in their nations."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>But nations are expressly mentioned among the sons of
Ham, as I showed above. "Mizraim begat those who are
called Ludim;" and so also of the other seven nations. And
after enumerating all of them, it concludes, "These are the
sons of Ham, in their families, according to their languages, in
their territories, and in their nations." The reason, then, why
the children of several of them are not mentioned, is that they
belonged by birth to other nations, and did not themselves
become nations. Why else is it, that though eight sons are
reckoned to Japheth, the sons of only two of these are mentioned;
and though four are reckoned to Ham, only three are
spoken of as having sons; and though six are reckoned to
Shem, the descendants of only two of these are traced? Did
the rest remain childless? We cannot suppose so; but they
did not produce nations so great as to warrant their being
mentioned, but were absorbed in the nations to which they
belonged by birth.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Of the diversity of languages, and of the founding of Babylon.</i></p>

<p>But though these nations are said to have been dispersed
according to their languages, yet the narrator recurs to that
time when all had but one language, and explains how it
came to pass that a diversity of languages was introduced.
"The whole earth," he says, "was of one lip, and all had one
speech. And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the
east, that they found a plain in the land of Shinar, and dwelt
there. And they said one to another, Come, and let us make
bricks, and burn them thoroughly. And they had bricks for
stone, and slime for mortar. And they said, Come, and let us
build for ourselves a city, and a tower whose top shall reach
the sky; and let us make us a name, before we be scattered
abroad on the face of all the earth. And the Lord came down
to see the city and the tower, which the children, of men
builded. And the Lord God said, Behold, the people is one,
and they have all one language; and this they begin to do:
and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they
have imagined to do. Come, and let us go down, and confound
there their language, that they may not understand one
another's speech. And God scattered them thence on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
face of all the earth: and they left off to build the city and
the tower. Therefore the name of it is called Confusion;
because the Lord did there confound the language of all the
earth: and the Lord God scattered them thence on the face of
all the earth."<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> This city, which was called Confusion, is the
same as Babylon, whose wonderful construction Gentile history
also notices. For Babylon means Confusion. Whence we
conclude that the giant Nimrod was its founder, as had been
hinted a little before, where Scripture, in speaking of him,
says that the beginning of his kingdom was Babylon, that is,
Babylon had a supremacy over the other cities as the metropolis
and royal residence; although it did not rise to the
grand dimensions designed by its proud and impious founder.
The plan was to make it so high that it should reach the sky,
whether this was meant of one tower which they intended to
build higher than the others, or of all the towers, which might
be signified by the singular number, as we speak of "the
soldier," meaning the army, and of the frog or the locust, when
we refer to the whole multitude of frogs and locusts in the
plagues with which Moses smote the Egyptians.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> But what
did these vain and presumptuous men intend? How did
they expect to raise this lofty mass against God, when they
had built it above all the mountains and the clouds of the
earth's atmosphere? What injury could any spiritual or
material elevation do to God? The safe and true way to
heaven is made by humility, which lifts up the heart to the
Lord, not against Him; as this giant is said to have been a
"hunter <i>against</i> the Lord." This has been misunderstood by
some through the ambiguity of the Greek word, and they have
translated it, not "against the Lord," but "before the Lord;"
for &#7956;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#959;&#957; means both "before" and "against." In the
Psalm this word is rendered, "Let us weep <i>before</i> the Lord
our Maker."<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The same word occurs in the book of Job,
where it is written, "Thou hast broken into fury <i>against</i> the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> And so this giant is to be recognised as a "hunter
<i>against</i> the Lord." And what is meant by the term "hunter"
but deceiver, oppressor, and destroyer of the animals of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
earth? He and his people, therefore, erected this tower
against the Lord, and so gave expression to their impious
pride; and justly was their wicked intention punished by
God, even though it was unsuccessful. But what was the
nature of the punishment? As the tongue is the instrument
of domination, in it pride was punished; so that man, who
would not understand God when He issued His commands,
should be misunderstood when he himself gave orders. Thus
was that conspiracy disbanded, for each man retired from
those he could not understand, and associated with those
whose speech was intelligible; and the nations were divided
according to their languages, and scattered over the earth as
seemed good to God, who accomplished this in ways hidden
from and incomprehensible to us.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of God's coming down to confound the languages of the builders of the city.</i></p>

<p>We read, "The Lord came down to see the city and the
tower which the sons of men built:" it was not the sons of
God, but that society which lived in a merely human way,
and which we call the earthly city. God, who is always
wholly everywhere, does not move locally; but He is said to
descend when He does anything in the earth out of the usual
course, which, as it were, makes His presence felt. And in
the same way, He does not by "seeing" learn some new
thing, for He cannot ever be ignorant of anything; but He is
said to see and recognise, in time, that which He causes
others to see and recognise. And therefore that city was
not previously being seen as God made it be seen when He
showed how offensive it was to Him. We might, indeed,
interpret God's descending to the city of the descent of His
angels in whom He dwells; so that the following words,
"And the Lord God said, Behold, they are all one race and
of one language," and also what follows, "Come, and let us
go down and confound their speech," are a recapitulation, explaining
how the previously intimated "descent of the Lord"
was accomplished. For if He had already gone down, why
does He say, "Come, and let us go down and confound?"&mdash;words
which seem to be addressed to the angels, and to intimate
that He who was in the angels descended in their descent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
And the words most appropriately are, not, "Go ye
down and confound," but, "Let us confound their speech;"
showing that He so works by His servants, that they are
themselves also fellow-labourers with God, as the apostle says,
"For we are fellow-labourers with God."<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>


<p class="center">6. <i>What we are to understand by God's speaking to the angels.</i></p>

<p>We might have supposed that the words uttered at the
creation of man, "Let us," and not Let me, "make man," were
addressed to the angels, had He not added "in our image;"
but as we cannot believe that man was made in the image of
angels, or that the image of God is the same as that of angels,
it is proper to refer this expression to the plurality of the
Trinity. And yet this Trinity, being one God, even after
saying "Let <i>us</i> make," goes on to say, "And God made man
in His image,"<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and not "Gods made," or "in their image."
And were there any difficulty in applying to the angels the
words, "Come, and let us go down and confound their speech,"
we might refer the plural to the Trinity, as if the Father were
addressing the Son and the Holy Spirit; but it rather belongs
to the angels to approach God by holy movements, that is,
by pious thoughts, and thereby to avail themselves of the unchangeable
truth which rules in the court of heaven as their
eternal law. For they are not themselves the truth; but partaking
in the creative truth, they are moved towards it as the
fountain of life, that what they have not in themselves they
may obtain in it. And this movement of theirs is steady,
for they never go back from what they have reached. And
to these angels God does not speak, as we speak to one another,
or to God, or to angels, or as the angels speak to us, or
as God speaks to us through them: He speaks to them in an
ineffable manner of His own, and that which He says is conveyed
to us in a manner suited to our capacity. For the
speaking of God antecedent and superior to all His works,
is the immutable reason of His work: it has no noisy and
passing sound, but an energy eternally abiding and producing
results in time. Thus He speaks to the holy angels; but to
us, who are far off, He speaks otherwise. When, however, we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
hear with the inner ear some part of the speech of God, we
approximate to the angels. But in this work I need not
labour to give an account of the ways in which God speaks.
For either the unchangeable Truth speaks directly to the mind
of the rational creature in some indescribable way, or speaks
through the changeable creature, either presenting spiritual
images to our spirit, or bodily voices to our bodily sense.</p>

<p>The words, "Nothing will be restrained from them which
they have imagined to do,"<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> are assuredly not meant as an
affirmation, but as an interrogation, such as is used by persons
threatening, as, <i>e.g.</i>, when Dido exclaims,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"They will not take arms and pursue?"<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>We are to understand the words as if it had been said, Shall
nothing be restrained from them which they have imagined to
do?<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> From these three men, therefore, the three sons of
Noah we mean, 73, or rather, as the catalogue will show, 72
nations and as many languages were dispersed over the earth,
and as they increased filled even the islands. But the nations
multiplied much more than the languages. For even in
Africa we know several barbarous nations which have but
one language; and who can doubt that, as the human race
increased, men contrived to pass to the islands in ships?</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Whether even the remotest islands received their</i> <span class="smcap">fauna</span> <i>from the animals
which were preserved, through the deluge, in the ark</i>.</p>

<p>There is a question raised about all those kinds of beasts
which are not domesticated, nor are produced like frogs from
the earth, but are propagated by male and female parents,
such as wolves and animals of that kind; and it is asked how
they could be found in the islands after the deluge, in which
all the animals not in the ark perished, unless the breed was
restored from those which were preserved in pairs in the ark.
It might, indeed, be said that they crossed to the islands by
swimming, but this could only be true of those very near the
mainland; whereas there are some so distant, that we fancy
no animal could swim to them. But if men caught them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and took them across with themselves, and thus propagated
these breeds in their new abodes, this would not imply an
incredible fondness for the chase. At the same time, it cannot
be denied that by the intervention of angels they might
be transferred by God's order or permission. If, however,
they were produced out of the earth as at their first creation,
when God said, "Let the earth bring forth the living creature,"<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
this makes it more evident that all kinds of animals
were preserved in the ark, not so much for the sake of renewing
the stock, as of prefiguring the various nations which
were to be saved in the church; this, I say, is more evident,
if the earth brought forth many animals in islands to which
they could not cross over.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Whether certain monstrous races of men are derived from the stock of Adam
or Noah's sons.</i></p>

<p>It is also asked whether we are to believe that certain
monstrous races of men, spoken of in secular history,<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> have
sprung from Noah's sons, or rather, I should say, from that
one man from whom they themselves were descended. For
it is reported that some have one eye in the middle of the
forehead; some, feet turned backwards from the heel; some,
a double sex, the right breast like a man, the left like a woman,
and that they alternately beget and bring forth: others
are said to have no mouth, and to breathe only through the
nostrils; others are but a cubit high, and are therefore called
by the Greeks "Pigmies:"<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> they say that in some places the
women conceive in their fifth year, and do not live beyond
their eighth. So, too, they tell of a race who have two feet
but only one leg, and are of marvellous swiftness, though they
do not bend the knee: they are called Skiopodes, because in
the hot weather they lie down on their backs and shade themselves
with their feet. Others are said to have no head, and
their eyes in their shoulders; and other human or quasi-human
races are depicted in mosaic in the harbour esplanade
of Carthage, on the faith of histories of rarities. What shall
I say of the Cynocephali, whose dog-like head and barking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
proclaim them beasts rather than men? But we are not
bound to believe all we hear of these monstrosities. But
whoever is anywhere born a man, that is, a rational mortal
animal, no matter what unusual appearance he presents in
colour, movement, sound, nor how peculiar he is in some
power, part, or quality of his nature, no Christian can doubt
that he springs from that one protoplast. We can distinguish
the common human nature from that which is peculiar, and
therefore wonderful.</p>

<p>The same account which is given of monstrous births in
individual cases can be given of monstrous races. For God,
the Creator of all, knows where and when each thing ought to
be, or to have been created, because He sees the similarities
and diversities which can contribute to the beauty of the
whole. But he who cannot see the whole is offended by
the deformity of the part, because he is blind to that which
balances it, and to which it belongs. We know that men are
born with more than four fingers on their hands or toes on
their feet: this is a smaller matter; but far from us be the
folly of supposing that the Creator mistook the number of a
man's fingers, though we cannot account for the difference.
And so in cases where the divergence from the rule is greater.
He whose works no man justly finds fault with, knows what
He has done. At Hippo-Diarrhytus there is a man whose
hands are crescent-shaped, and have only two fingers each,
and his feet similarly formed. If there were a race like him,
it would be added to the history of the curious and wonderful.
Shall we therefore deny that this man is descended
from that one man who was first created? As for the Androgyni,
or Hermaphrodites, as they are called, though they are
rare, yet from time to time there appear persons of sex so
doubtful, that it remains uncertain from which sex they take
their name; though it is customary to give them a masculine
name, as the more worthy. For no one ever called them
Hermaphroditesses. Some years ago, quite within my own
memory, a man was born in the East, double in his upper,
but single in his lower half&mdash;having two heads, two chests,
four hands, but one body and two feet like an ordinary man;
and he lived so long that many had an opportunity of seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
him. But who could enumerate all the human births that have
differed widely from their ascertained parents? As, therefore,
no one will deny that these are all descended from that one
man, so all the races which are reported to have diverged in
bodily appearance from the usual course which nature generally
or almost universally preserves, if they are embraced in
that definition of man as rational and mortal animals, unquestionably
trace their pedigree to that one first father of all.
We are supposing these stories about various races who differ
from one another and from us to be true; but possibly they are
not: for if we were not aware that apes, and monkeys, and
sphinxes are not men, but beasts, those historians would possibly
describe them as races of men, and flaunt with impunity
their false and vainglorious discoveries. But supposing they
are men of whom these marvels are recorded, what if God has
seen fit to create some races in this way, that we might not
suppose that the monstrous births which appear among ourselves
are the failures of that wisdom whereby He fashions
the human nature, as we speak of the failure of a less perfect
workman? Accordingly, it ought not to seem absurd to us,
that as in individual races there are monstrous births, so in
the whole race there are monstrous races. Wherefore, to conclude
this question cautiously and guardedly, either these
things which have been told of some races have no existence
at all; or if they do exist, they are not human races; or if
they are human, they are descended from Adam.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Whether we are to believe in the Antipodes.</i></p>

<p>But as to the fable that there are Antipodes, that is to say,
men on the opposite side of the earth, where the sun rises
when it sets to us, men who walk with their feet opposite ours,
that is on no ground credible. And, indeed, it is not affirmed
that this has been learned by historical knowledge, but by
scientific conjecture, on the ground that the earth is suspended
within the concavity of the sky, and that it has as much room
on the one side of it as on the other: hence they say that
the part which is beneath must also be inhabited. But they
do not remark that, although it be supposed or scientifically
demonstrated that the world is of a round and spherical form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
yet it does not follow that the other side of the earth is bare
of water; nor even, though it be bare, does it immediately
follow that it is peopled. For Scripture, which proves the
truth of its historical statements by the accomplishment of its
prophecies, gives no false information; and it is too absurd to
say, that some men might have taken ship and traversed the
whole wide ocean, and crossed from this side of the world to
the other, and that thus even the inhabitants of that distant
region are descended from that one first man. Wherefore let
us seek if we can find the city of God that sojourns on earth
among those human races who are catalogued as having been
divided into seventy-two nations and as many languages. For
it continued down to the deluge and the ark, and is proved to
have existed still among the sons of Noah by their blessings,
and chiefly in the eldest son Shem; for Japheth received this
blessing, that he should dwell in the tents of Shem.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Of the genealogy of Shem, in whose line the city of God is preserved till the
time of Abraham.</i></p>

<p>It is necessary, therefore, to preserve the series of generations
descending from Shem, for the sake of exhibiting the
city of God after the flood; as before the flood it was exhibited
in the series of generations descending from Seth. And therefore
does divine Scripture, after exhibiting the earthly city as
Babylon or "Confusion," revert to the patriarch Shem, and
recapitulate the generations from him to Abraham, specifying
besides, the year in which each father begat the son that belonged
to this line, and how long he lived. And unquestionably
it is this which fulfils the promise I made, that it should
appear why it is said of the sons of Heber, "The name of the
one was Peleg, for in his days the earth was divided."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> For
what can we understand by the division of the earth, if not
the diversity of languages? And, therefore, omitting the
other sons of Shem, who are not concerned in this matter,
Scripture gives the genealogy of those by whom the line runs
on to Abraham, as before the flood those are given who carried
on the line to Noah from Seth. Accordingly this series of
generations begins thus: "These are the generations of Shem:
Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
years after the flood. And Shem lived after he begat
Arphaxad five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters."
In like manner it registers the rest, naming the year of his
life in which each begat the son who belonged to that line
which extends to Abraham. It specifies, too, how many years
he lived thereafter, begetting sons and daughters, that we may
not childishly suppose that the men named were the only
men, but may understand how the population increased, and
how regions and kingdoms so vast could be populated by the
descendants of Shem; especially the kingdom of Assyria, from
which Ninus subdued the surrounding nations, reigning with
brilliant prosperity, and bequeathing to his descendants a vast
but thoroughly consolidated empire, which held together for
many centuries.</p>

<p>But to avoid needless prolixity, we shall mention not the
number of years each member of this series lived, but only
the year of his life in which he begat his heir, that we may
thus reckon the number of years from the flood to Abraham,
and may at the same time leave room to touch briefly and
cursorily upon some other matters necessary to our argument.
In the second year, then, after the flood, Shem when he was
a hundred years old begat Arphaxad; Arphaxad when he was
135 years old begat Cainan; Cainan when he was 130 years
begat Salah. Salah himself, too, was the same age when he
begat Eber. Eber lived 134 years, and begat Peleg, in whose
days the earth was divided. Peleg himself lived 130 years,
and begat Reu; and Reu lived 132 years, and begat Serug;
Serug 130, and begat Nahor; and Nahor 79, and begat Terah;
and Terah 70, and begat Abram, whose name God afterwards
changed into <i>Abraham</i>. There are thus from the flood to
Abraham 1072 years, according to the Vulgate or Septuagint
versions. In the Hebrew copies far fewer years are given; and
for this either no reason or a not very credible one is given.</p>

<p>When, therefore, we look for the city of God in these
seventy-two nations, we cannot affirm that while they had
but one lip, that is, one language, the human race had departed
from the worship of the true God, and that genuine
godliness had survived only in those generations which descend
from Shem through Arphaxad and reach to Abraham;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
but from the time when they proudly built a tower to heaven,
a symbol of godless exaltation, the city or society of the
wicked becomes apparent. Whether it was only disguised
before, or non-existent; whether both cities remained after the
flood,&mdash;the godly in the two sons of Noah who were blessed, and
in their posterity, and the ungodly in the cursed son and his
descendants, from whom sprang that mighty hunter against
the Lord,&mdash;is not easily determined. For possibly&mdash;and certainly
this is more credible&mdash;there were despisers of God
among the descendants of the two sons, even before Babylon
was founded, and worshippers of God among the descendants
of Ham. Certainly neither race was ever obliterated from
earth. For in both the Psalms in which it is said, "They
are all gone aside, they are altogether become filthy; there is
none that doeth good, no, not one," we read further, "Have
all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
people as they eat bread, and call not upon the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> There
was then a people of God even at that time. And therefore
the words, "There is none that doeth good, no, not one," were
said of the sons of men, not of the sons of God. For it had
been previously said, "God looked down from heaven upon
the sons of men, to see if any understood and sought after
God;" and then follow the words which demonstrate that all
the sons of men, that is, all who belong to the city which
lives according to man, not according to God, are reprobate.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>11. <i>That the original language in use among men was that which was afterwards
called Hebrew, from Heber, in whose family it was preserved when the
confusion of tongues occurred.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Wherefore, as the fact of all using one language did not
secure the absence of sin-infected men from the race,&mdash;for even
before the deluge there was one language, and yet all but the
single family of just Noah were found worthy of destruction
by the flood,&mdash;so when the nations, by a prouder godlessness,
earned the punishment of the dispersion and the confusion of
tongues, and the city of the godless was called Confusion or
Babylon, there was still the house of Heber in which the primitive
language of the race survived. And therefore, as I
have already mentioned, when an enumeration is made of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
sons of Shem, who each founded a nation, Heber is first mentioned,
although he was of the fifth generation from Shem.
And because, when the other races were divided by their own
peculiar languages, his family preserved that language which
is not unreasonably believed to have been the common
language of the race, it was on this account thenceforth
named Hebrew. For it then became necessary to distinguish
this language from the rest by a proper name; though, while
there was only one, it had no other name than the language
of man, or human speech, it alone being spoken by the whole
human race. Some one will say: If the earth was divided
by languages in the days of Peleg, Heber's son, that language,
which was formerly common to all, should rather have been
called after Peleg. But we are to understand that Heber
himself gave to his son this name Peleg, which means Division;
because he was born when the earth was divided, that is, at
the very time of the division, and that this is the meaning of
the words, "In his days the earth was divided."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> For unless
Heber had been still alive when the languages were multiplied,
the language which was preserved in his house would not
have been called after him. We are induced to believe that
this was the primitive and common language, because the
multiplication and change of languages was introduced as a
punishment, and it is fit to ascribe to the people of God an
immunity from this punishment. Nor is it without significance
that this is the language which Abraham retained, and
that he could not transmit it to all his descendants, but only
to those of Jacob's line, who distinctively and eminently constituted
God's people, and received His covenants, and were
Christ's progenitors according to the flesh. In the same way,
Heber himself did not transmit that language to all his posterity,
but only to the line from which Abraham sprang. And
thus, although it is not expressly stated, that when the wicked
were building Babylon there was a godly seed remaining, this
indistinctness is intended to stimulate research rather than to
elude it. For when we see that originally there was one
common language, and that Heber is mentioned before all
Shem's sons, though he belonged to the fifth generation from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
him, and that the language which the patriarchs and prophets
used, not only in their conversation, but in the authoritative
language of Scripture, is called Hebrew, when we are asked
where that primitive and common language was preserved
after the confusion of tongues, certainly, as there can be no
doubt that those among whom it was preserved were exempt
from the punishment it embodied, what other suggestion can
we make, than that it survived in the family of him whose
name it took, and that this is no small proof of the righteousness
of this family, that the punishment with which the other
families were visited did not fall upon it?</p>

<p>But yet another question is mooted: How did Heber and
his son Peleg each found a nation, if they had but one language?
For no doubt the Hebrew nation propagated from Heber through
Abraham, and becoming through him a great people, is one
nation. How, then, are all the sons of the three branches of
Noah's family enumerated as founding a nation each, if Heber
and Peleg did not so? It is very probable that the giant
Nimrod founded also his nation, and that Scripture has named
him separately on account of the extraordinary dimensions of
his empire and of his body, so that the number of seventy-two
nations remains. But Peleg was mentioned, not because he
founded a nation (for his race and language are Hebrew), but
on account of the critical time at which he was born, all the
earth being then divided. Nor ought we to be surprised that
the giant Nimrod lived to the time in which Babylon was
founded and the confusion of tongues occurred, and the consequent
division of the earth. For though Heber was in the
sixth generation from Noah, and Nimrod in the fourth, it does
not follow that they could not be alive at the same time. For
when the generations are few, they live longer and are born
later; but when they are many, they live a shorter time, and
come into the world earlier. We are to understand that, when
the earth was divided, the descendants of Noah who are registered
as founders of nations were not only already born, but
were of an age to have immense families, worthy to be called
tribes or nations. And therefore we must by no means
suppose that they were born in the order in which they were
set down; otherwise, how could the twelve sons of Joktan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
another son of Heber's, and brother of Peleg, have already
founded nations, if Joktan was born, as he is registered, after
his brother Peleg, since the earth was divided at Peleg's birth?
We are therefore to understand that, though Peleg is named
first, he was born long after Joktan, whose twelve sons had
already families so large as to admit of their being divided by
different languages. There is nothing extraordinary in the
last born being first named: of the sons of Noah, the descendants
of Japheth are first named; then the sons of Ham, who
was the second son; and last the sons of Shem, who was the
first and oldest. Of these nations the names have partly survived,
so that at this day we can see from whom they have
sprung, as the Assyrians from Assur, the Hebrews from Heber,
but partly have been altered in the lapse of time, so that the
most learned men, by profound research in ancient records,
have scarcely been able to discover the origin, I do not say of
all, but of some of these nations. There is, for example,
nothing in the name Egyptians to show that they are descended
from Misraim, Ham's son, nor in the name Ethiopians to show
a connection with Cush, though such is said to be the origin
of these nations. And if we take a general survey of the
names, we shall find that more have been changed than have
remained the same.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Of the era in Abraham's life from which a new period in the holy
succession begins.</i></p>

<p>Let us now survey the progress of the city of God from the
era of the patriarch Abraham, from whose time it begins to
be more conspicuous, and the divine promises which are now
fulfilled in Christ are more fully revealed. We learn, then,
from the intimations of holy Scripture, that Abraham was
born in the country of the Chaldeans, a land belonging to
the Assyrian empire. Now, even at that time impious superstitions
were rife with the Chaldeans, as with other nations.
The family of Terah, to which Abraham belonged, was the
only one in which the worship of the true God survived, and
the only one, we may suppose, in which the Hebrew language
was preserved; although Joshua the son of Nun tells us that
even this family served other gods in Mesopotamia.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
other descendants of Heber gradually became absorbed in other
races and other languages. And thus, as the single family of
Noah was preserved through the deluge of water to renew the
human race, so, in the deluge of superstition that flooded the
whole world, there remained but the one family of Terah in
which the seed of God's city was preserved. And as, when
Scripture has enumerated the generations prior to Noah, with
their ages, and explained the cause of the flood before God
began to speak to Noah about the building of the ark, it is
said, "These are the generations of Noah;" so also now, after
enumerating the generations from Shem, Noah's son, down to
Abraham, it then signalizes an era by saying, "These are the
generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran;
and Haran begat Lot. And Haran died before his father
Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. And
Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's
wife was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife Milcah, the
daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of
Iscah."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> This Iscah is supposed to be the same as Sarah,
Abraham's wife.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>13. <i>Why, in the account of Terah's emigration, on his forsaking the Chaldeans
and passing over into Mesopotamia, no mention is made of his son Nahor.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Next it is related how Terah with his family left the
region of the Chaldeans and came into Mesopotamia, and
dwelt in Haran. But nothing is said about one of his sons
called Nahor, as if he had not taken him along with him.
For the narrative runs thus: "And Terah took Abram his
son, and Lot the son of Haran, his son's son, and Sarah his
daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife, and led them forth
out of the region of the Chaldeans to go into the land of
Canaan; and he came into Haran, and dwelt there."<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> Nahor
and Milcah his wife are nowhere named here. But afterwards,
when Abraham sent his servant to take a wife for his
son Isaac, we find it thus written: "And the servant took ten
camels of the camels of his lord, and of all the goods of his
lord, with him; and arose, and went into Mesopotamia, into the
city of Nahor."<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> This and other testimonies of this sacred
history show that Nahor, Abraham's brother, had also left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
region of the Chaldeans, and fixed his abode in Mesopotamia,
where Abraham dwelt with his father. Why, then, did the
Scripture not mention him, when Terah with his family went
forth out of the Chaldean nation and dwelt in Haran, since it
mentions that he took with him not only Abraham his son,
but also Sarah his daughter-in-law, and Lot his grandson?
The only reason we can think of is, that perhaps he had lapsed
from the piety of his father and brother, and adhered to the
superstition of the Chaldeans, and had afterwards emigrated
thence, either through penitence, or because he was persecuted
as a suspected person. For in the book called Judith, when
Holofernes, the enemy of the Israelites, inquired what kind of
nation that might be, and whether war should be made against
them, Achior, the leader of the Ammonites, answered him thus:
"Let our lord now hear a word from the mouth of thy servant,
and I will declare unto thee the truth concerning the
people which dwelleth near thee in this hill country, and
there shall no lie come out of the mouth of thy servant. For
this people is descended from the Chaldeans, and they dwelt
heretofore in Mesopotamia, because they would not follow the
gods of their fathers, which were glorious in the land of the
Chaldeans, but went out of the way of their ancestors, and
adored the God of heaven, whom they knew; and they cast
them out from the face of their gods, and they fled into Mesopotamia,
and dwelt there many days. And their God said to
them, that they should depart from their habitation, and go
into the land of Canaan; and they dwelt,"<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> etc., as Achior the
Ammonite narrates. Whence it is manifest that the house of
Terah had suffered persecution from the Chaldeans for the
true piety with which they worshipped the one and true God.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the years of Terah, who completed his lifetime in Haran.</i></p>

<p>On Terah's death in Mesopotamia, where he is said to have
lived 205 years, the promises of God made to Abraham now
begin to be pointed out; for thus it is written: "And the days
of Terah in Haran were two hundred and five years, and he
died in Haran."<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> This is not to be taken as if he had spent
all his days there, but that he there completed the days of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
life, which were two hundred and five years: otherwise it
would not be known how many years Terah lived, since it is
not said in what year of his life he came into Haran; and it is
absurd to suppose that, in this series of generations, where it
is carefully recorded how many years each one lived, his age
was the only one not put on record. For although some
whom the same Scripture mentions have not their age recorded,
they are not in this series, in which the reckoning of
time is continuously indicated by the death of the parents and
the succession of the children. For this series, which is given
in order from Adam to Noah, and from him down to Abraham,
contains no one without the number of the years of his life.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Of the time of the migration of Abraham, when, according to the commandment
of God, he went out from Haran.</i></p>

<p>When, after the record of the death of Terah, the father of
Abraham, we next read, "And the Lord said to Abram, Get
thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy
father's house,"<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> etc., it is not to be supposed, because this
follows in the order of the narrative, that it also followed in
the chronological order of events. For if it were so, there
would be an insoluble difficulty. For after these words of
God which were spoken to Abraham, the Scripture says: "And
Abram departed, as the Lord had spoken unto him; and Lot
went with him. Now Abraham was seventy-five years old
when he departed out of Haran."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> How can this be true if he
departed from Haran after his father's death? For when Terah
was seventy years old, as is intimated above, he begat Abraham;
and if to this number we add the seventy-five years which
Abraham reckoned when he went out of Haran, we get 145
years. Therefore that was the number of the years of Terah,
when Abraham departed out of that city of Mesopotamia;
for he had reached the seventy-fifth year of his life, and
thus his father, who begat him in the seventieth year of his
life, had reached, as was said, his 145th. Therefore he did not
depart thence after his father's death, that is, after the 205
years his father lived; but the year of his departure from
that place, seeing it was his seventy-fifth, is inferred beyond
a doubt to have been the 145th of his father, who begat him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
in his seventieth year. And thus it is to be understood that
the Scripture, according to its custom, has gone back to the
time which had already been passed by the narrative; just as
above, when it had mentioned the grandsons of Noah, it said
that they were in their nations and tongues; and yet afterwards,
as if this also had followed in order of time, it says,
"And the whole earth was of one lip, and one speech for all."<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
How, then, could they be said to be in their own nations and
according to their own tongues, if there was one for all; except
because the narrative goes back to gather up what it had
passed over? Here, too, in the same way, after saying, "And
the days of Terah in Haran were 205 years, and Terah died
in Haran," the Scripture, going back to what had been passed
over in order to complete what had been begun about Terah,
says, "And the Lord said to Abram, Get thee out of thy
country,"<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> etc. After which words of God it is added, "And
Abram departed, as the Lord spake unto him; and Lot went
with him. But Abram was seventy-five years old when he
departed out of Haran." Therefore it was done when his
father was in the 145th year of his age; for it was then the
seventy-fifth of his own. But this question is also solved in
another way, that the seventy-five years of Abraham when he
departed out of Haran are reckoned from the year in which
he was delivered from the fire of the Chaldeans, not from that
of his birth, as if he was rather to be held as having been
born then.</p>

<p>Now the blessed Stephen, in narrating these things in the
Acts of the Apostles, says: "The God of glory appeared unto
our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he
dwelt in Charran, and said unto him, Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house,
and come into the land which I will show thee."<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> According
to these words of Stephen, God spoke to Abraham, not
after the death of his father, who certainly died in Haran,
where his son also dwelt with him, but before he dwelt in
that city, although he was already in Mesopotamia. Therefore
he had already departed from the Chaldeans. So that
when Stephen adds, "Then Abraham went out of the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the Chaldeans, and dwelt in Charran,"<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> this does not point
out what took place after God spoke to him (for it was not
after these words of God that he went out of the land of
the Chaldeans, since he says that God spoke to him in Mesopotamia),
but the word "<i>then</i>" which he uses refers to that
whole period from his going out of the land of the Chaldeans
and dwelling in Haran. Likewise in what follows, "And
thenceforth, when his father was dead, he settled him in this
land, wherein ye now dwell, and your fathers," he does not
say, after his father was dead he went out from Haran; but
thenceforth he settled him here, after his father was dead. It
is to be understood, therefore, that God had spoken to Abraham
when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran;
but that he came to Haran with his father, keeping in mind
the precept of God, and that he went out thence in his own
seventy-fifth year, which was his father's 145th. But he says
that his settlement in the land of Canaan, not his going forth
from Haran, took place after his father's death; because his
father was already dead when he purchased the land, and personally
entered on possession of it. But when, on his having
already settled in Mesopotamia, that is, already gone out of
the land of the Chaldeans, God says, "Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house,"<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a>
this means, not that he should cast out his body from thence,
for he had already done that, but that he should tear away
his soul. For he had not gone out from thence in mind, if
he was held by the hope and desire of returning,&mdash;a hope and
desire which was to be cut off by God's command and help,
and by his own obedience. It would indeed be no incredible
supposition that afterwards, when Nahor followed his father,
Abraham then fulfilled the precept of the Lord, that he should
depart out of Haran with Sarah his wife and Lot his brother's
son.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of the order and nature of the promises of God which were made to
Abraham.</i></p>

<p>God's promises made to Abraham are now to be considered;
for in these the oracles of our God,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> that is, of the true God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
began to appear more openly concerning the godly people,
whom prophetic authority foretold. The first of these reads
thus: "And the Lord said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy
country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house,
and go into a land that I will show thee: and I will make of
thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and magnify thy
name; and thou shalt be blessed: and I will bless them that
bless thee, and curse them that curse thee: and in thee shall
all tribes of the earth be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> Now it is to be observed
that two things are promised to Abraham, the one, that his
seed should possess the land of Canaan, which is intimated
when it is said, "Go into a land that I will show thee, and I
will make of thee a great nation;" but the other far more
excellent, not about the carnal but the spiritual seed, through
which he is the father, not of the one Israelite nation, but of
all nations who follow the footprints of his faith, which was
first promised in these words, "And in thee shall all tribes of
the earth be blessed." Eusebius thought this promise was
made in Abraham's seventy-fifth year, as if soon after it was
made Abraham had departed out of Haran; because the Scripture
cannot be contradicted, in which we read, "Abram was
seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran."
But if this promise was made in that year, then of course
Abraham was staying in Haran with his father; for he could
not depart thence unless he had first dwelt there. Does this,
then, contradict what Stephen says, "The God of glory appeared
to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia,
before he dwelt in Charran?"<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> But it is to be understood that
the whole took place in the same year,&mdash;both the promise of
God before Abraham dwelt in Haran, and his dwelling in
Haran, and his departure thence,&mdash;not only because Eusebius
in the Chronicles reckons from the year of this promise, and
shows that after 430 years the exodus from Egypt took place,
when the law was given, but because the Apostle Paul also
mentions it.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>17. <i>Of the three most famous kingdoms of the nations, of which one, that is, the
Assyrian, was already very eminent when Abraham was born.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>During the same period there were three famous kingdoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
of the nations, in which the city of the earth-born, that is, the
society of men living according to man under the domination
of the fallen angels, chiefly flourished, namely, the three kingdoms
of Sicyon, Egypt, and Assyria. Of these, Assyria was
much the most powerful and sublime; for that king Ninus,
son of Belus, had subdued the people of all Asia except India.
By Asia I now mean not that part which is one province of
this greater Asia, but what is called Universal Asia, which
some set down as the half, but most as the third part of the
whole world,&mdash;the three being Asia, Europe, and Africa, thereby
making an unequal division. For the part called Asia stretches
from the south through the east even to the north; Europe
from the north even to the west; and Africa from the west
even to the south. Thus we see that two, Europe and Africa,
contain one half of the world, and Asia alone the other half.
And these two parts are made by the circumstance, that there
enters between them from the ocean all the Mediterranean water,
which makes this great sea of ours. So that, if you divide the
world into two parts, the east and the west, Asia will be in the
one, and Europe and Africa in the other. So that of the three
kingdoms then famous, one, namely Sicyon, was not under
the Assyrians, because it was in Europe; but as for Egypt,
how could it fail to be subject to the empire which ruled all
Asia with the single exception of India? In Assyria, therefore,
the dominion of the impious city had the pre-eminence.
Its head was Babylon,&mdash;an earth-born city, most fitly named,
for it means confusion. There Ninus reigned after the death of
his father Belus, who first had reigned there sixty-five years.
His son Ninus, who, on his father's death, succeeded to the
kingdom, reigned fifty-two years, and had been king forty-three
years when Abraham was born, which was about the
1200th year before Rome was founded, as it were another
Babylon in the west.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of the repeated address of God to Abraham, in which He promised the
land of Canaan to him and to his seed.</i></p>

<p>Abraham, then, having departed out of Haran in the
seventy-fifth year of his own age, and in the hundred and
forty-fifth of his father's, went with Lot, his brother's son,
and Sarah his wife, into the land of Canaan, and came even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Sichem, where again he received the divine oracle, of which
it is thus written: "And the Lord appeared unto Abram,
and said unto him, Unto thy seed will I give this land."<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a>
Nothing is promised here about that seed in which he is
made the father of all nations, but only about that by which
he is the father of the one Israelite nation; for by this seed
that land was possessed.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of the divine preservation of Sarah's chastity in Egypt, when Abraham
had called her not his wife but his sister.</i></p>

<p>Having built an altar there, and called upon God, Abraham
proceeded thence and dwelt in the desert, and was compelled by
pressure of famine to go on into Egypt. There he called his
wife his sister, and told no lie. For she was this also, because
she was near of blood; just as Lot, on account of the same
nearness, being his brother's son, is called his brother. Now
he did not deny that she was his wife, but held his peace
about it, committing to God the defence of his wife's chastity,
and providing as a man against human wiles; because if he
had not provided against the danger as much as he could, he
would have been tempting God rather than trusting in Him.
We have said enough about this matter against the calumnies
of Faustus the Manich√¶an. At last what Abraham had expected
the Lord to do took place. For Pharaoh, king of
Egypt, who had taken her to him as his wife, restored her to
her husband on being severely plagued. And far be it from
us to believe that she was defiled by lying with another;
because it is much more credible that, by these great afflictions,
Pharaoh was not permitted to do this.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the parting of Lot and Abraham, which they agreed to without breach
of charity.</i></p>

<p>On Abraham's return out of Egypt to the place he had left,
Lot, his brother's son, departed from him into the land of Sodom,
without breach of charity. For they had grown rich, and
began to have many herdmen of cattle, and when these strove
together, they avoided in this way the pugnacious discord of
their families. Indeed, as human affairs go, this cause might
even have given rise to some strife between themselves. Consequently
these are the words of Abraham to Lot, when taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
precaution against this evil, "Let there be no strife between
me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen; for
we be brethren. Behold, is not the whole land before thee?
Separate thyself from me: if thou wilt go to the left hand, I
will go to the right; or if thou wilt go to the right hand, I
will go to the left."<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> From this, perhaps, has arisen a pacific
custom among men, that when there is any partition of earthly
things, the greater should make the division, the less the
choice.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the third promise of God, by which He assured the land of Canaan to
Abraham and his seed in perpetuity.</i></p>

<p>Now, when Abraham and Lot had separated, and dwelt
apart, owing to the necessity of supporting their families, and
not to vile discord, and Abraham was in the land of Canaan,
but Lot in Sodom, the Lord said to Abraham in a third oracle,
"Lift up thine eyes, and look from the place where thou now
art, to the north, and to Africa, and to the east, and to the
sea; for all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it,
and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the
dust of the earth: if any one can number the dust of the earth,
thy seed shall also be numbered. Arise, and walk through
the land, in the length of it, and in the breadth of it; for unto
thee will I give it."<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> It does not clearly appear whether in
this promise that also is contained by which he is made the
father of all nations. For the clause, "And I will make thy
seed as the dust of the earth," may seem to refer to this, being
spoken by that figure the Greeks call hyperbole, which indeed
is figurative, not literal. But no person of understanding can
doubt in what manner the Scripture uses this and other
figures. For that figure (that is, way of speaking) is used
when what is said is far larger than what is meant by it;
for who does not see how incomparably larger the number of
the dust must be than that of all men can be from Adam
himself down to the end of the world? How much greater,
then, must it be than the seed of Abraham,&mdash;not only that
pertaining to the nation of Israel, but also that which is and
shall be according to the imitation of faith in all nations of the
whole wide world! For that seed is indeed very small in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
comparison with the multitude of the wicked, although even
those few of themselves make an innumerable multitude,
which by a hyperbole is compared to the dust of the earth.
Truly that multitude which was promised to Abraham is not
innumerable to God, although to man; but to God not even
the dust of the earth is so. Further, the promise here made
may be understood not only of the nation of Israel, but of the
whole seed of Abraham, which may be fitly compared to the dust
for multitude, because regarding it also there is the promise<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> of
many children, not according to the flesh, but according to the
spirit. But we have therefore said that this does not clearly
appear, because the multitude even of that one nation, which
was born according to the flesh of Abraham through his
grandson Jacob, has increased so much as to fill almost all
parts of the world. Consequently, even it might by hyperbole
be compared to the dust for multitude, because even it alone
is innumerable by man. Certainly no one questions that only
that land is meant which is called Canaan. But that saying,
"To thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever," may move
some, if by "for ever" they understand "to eternity." But if
in this passage they take "for ever" thus, as we firmly hold
it means, that the beginning of the world to come is to be
ordered from the end of the present, there is still no difficulty,
because, although the Israelites are expelled from Jerusalem,
they still remain in other cities in the land of Canaan, and
shall remain even to the end; and when that whole land is inhabited
by Christians, they also are the very seed of Abraham.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Of Abraham's overcoming the enemies of Sodom, when he delivered Lot
from captivity and was blessed by Melchizedek the priest.</i></p>

<p>Having received this oracle of promise, Abraham migrated,
and remained in another place of the same land, that is,
beside the oak of Mamre, which was Hebron. Then on
the invasion of Sodom, when five kings carried on war
against four, and Lot was taken captive with the conquered
Sodomites, Abraham delivered him from the enemy, leading
with him to battle three hundred and eighteen of his home-born
servants, and won the victory for the kings of Sodom,
but would take nothing of the spoils when offered by the king<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
for whom he had won them. He was then openly blessed by
Melchizedek, who was priest of God Most High, about whom
many and great things are written in the epistle which is inscribed
to the Hebrews, which most say is by the Apostle
Paul, though some deny this. For then first appeared the
sacrifice which is now offered to God by Christians in the
whole wide world, and that is fulfilled which long after the
event was said by the prophet to Christ, who was yet to come
in the flesh, "Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
Melchizedek,"<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a>&mdash;that is to say, not after the order of Aaron,
for that order was to be taken away when the things shone
forth which were intimated beforehand by these shadows.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>23. <i>Of the word of the Lord to Abraham, by which it was promised to him that
his posterity should be multiplied according to the multitude of the stars;
on believing which he was declared justified while yet in uncircumcision.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The word of the Lord came to Abraham in a vision also.
For when God promised him protection and exceeding great
reward, he, being solicitous about posterity, said that a certain
Eliezer of Damascus, born in his house, would be his heir.
Immediately he was promised an heir, not that house-born
servant, but one who was to come forth of Abraham himself;
and again a seed innumerable, not as the dust of the earth,
but as the stars of heaven,&mdash;which rather seems to me a promise
of a posterity exalted in celestial felicity. For, so far as
multitude is concerned, what are the stars of heaven to the
dust of the earth, unless one should say the comparison is like
inasmuch as the stars also cannot be numbered? For it is not
to be believed that all of them can be seen. For the more
keenly one observes them, the more does he see. So that it is
to be supposed some remain concealed from the keenest observers,
to say nothing of those stars which are said to rise and
set in another part of the world most remote from us. Finally,
the authority of this book condemns those like Aratus or
Eudoxus, or any others who boast that they have found out and
written down the complete number of the stars. Here, indeed,
is set down that sentence which the apostle quotes in order to
commend the grace of God, "Abraham believed God, and it
was counted to him for righteousness;"<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> lest the circumcision<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
should glory, and be unwilling to receive the uncircumcised
nations to the faith of Christ. For at the time when he believed,
and his faith was counted to him for righteousness,
Abraham had not yet been circumcised.</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap24"></a>24. <i>Of the meaning of the sacrifice Abraham was commanded to offer when he
supplicated to be taught about those things he had believed.</i></p>

<p>In the same vision, God in speaking to him also says, "I
am God that brought thee out of the region of the Chaldees,
to give thee this land to inherit it."<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> And when Abram
asked whereby he might know that he should inherit it, God
said to him, "Take me an heifer of three years old, and a
she-goat of three years old, and a ram of three years old, and
a turtle-dove, and a pigeon. And he took unto him all these,
and divided them in the midst, and laid each piece one against
another; but the birds divided he not. And the fowls came
down," as it is written, "on the carcases, and Abram sat
down by them. But about the going down of the sun, great
fear fell upon Abram; and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell
upon him. And He said unto Abram, Know of a surety that
thy seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they shall
reduce them to servitude; and shall afflict them four hundred
years: but the nation whom they shall serve will I judge;
and afterward shall they come out hither with great substance.
And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; kept in a good old
age. But in the fourth generation they shall come hither
again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full. And
when the sun was setting, there was a flame, and a smoking
furnace, and lamps of fire, that passed through between those
pieces. In that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram,
saying, Unto thy seed will I give this land, from the river of
Egypt unto the great river Euphrates: the Kenites, and the
Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites, and the Hittites, and the Perizzites,
and the Rephaims, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites,
and the Hivites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>All these things were said and done in a vision from God;
but it would take long, and would exceed the scope of this
work, to treat of them exactly in detail. It is enough that
we should know that, after it was said Abram believed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
God, and it was counted to him for righteousness, he did not
fail in faith in saying, "Lord God, whereby shall I know
that I shall inherit it?" for the inheritance of that land
was promised to him. Now he does not say, How shall I
know, as if he did not yet believe; but he says, "Whereby
shall I know," meaning that some sign might be given by
which he might know the manner of those things which he
had believed, just as it is not for lack of faith the Virgin
Mary says, "How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?"<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a>
for she inquired as to the way in which that should take
place which she was certain would come to pass. And when
she asked this, she was told, "The Holy Ghost shall come
upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow
thee."<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> Here also, in fine, a symbol was given, consisting of
three animals, a heifer, a she-goat, and a ram, and two birds,
a turtle-dove and pigeon, that he might know that the things
which he had not doubted should come to pass were to
happen in accordance with this symbol. Whether, therefore,
the heifer was a sign that the people should be put under the
law, the she-goat that the same people was to become sinful,
the ram that they should reign (and these animals are said to
be of three years old for this reason, that there are three
remarkable divisions of time, from Adam to Noah, and from
him to Abraham, and from him to David, who, on the rejection
of Saul, was first established by the will of the Lord in
the kingdom of the Israelite nation: in this third division,
which extends from Abraham to David, that people grew up
as if passing through the third age of life), or whether they
had some other more suitable meaning, still I have no doubt
whatever that spiritual things were prefigured by them as
well as by the turtle-dove and pigeon. And it is said, "But
the birds divided he not," because carnal men are divided
among themselves, but the spiritual not at all, whether they
seclude themselves from the busy conversation of men, like
the turtle-dove, or dwell among them, like the pigeon; for
both birds are simple and harmless, signifying that even in
the Israelite people, to which that land was to be given, there
would be individuals who were children of the promise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
heirs of the kingdom that is<a name="FNanchor_277_277" id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> to remain in eternal felicity.
But the fowls coming down on the divided carcases represent
nothing good, but the spirits of this air, seeking some food for
themselves in the division of carnal men. But that Abraham
sat down with them, signifies that even amid these divisions
of the carnal, true believers shall persevere to the end. And
that about the going down of the sun great fear fell upon
Abraham and a horror of great darkness, signifies that about
the end of this world believers shall be in great perturbation
and tribulation, of which the Lord said in the gospel, "For
then shall be great tribulation, such as was not from the
beginning."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>But what is said to Abraham, "Know of a surety that thy
seed shall be a stranger in a land not theirs, and they shall
reduce them to servitude, and shall afflict them 400 years,"
is most clearly a prophecy about the people of Israel which
was to be in servitude in Egypt. Not that this people was
to be in that servitude under the oppressive Egyptians for
400 years, but it is foretold that this should take place in
the course of those 400 years. For as it is written of
Terah the father of Abraham, "And the days of Terah in
Haran were 205 years,"<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> not because they were all spent
there, but because they were completed there, so it is
said here also, "And they shall reduce them to servitude,
and shall afflict them 400 years," for this reason, because
that number was completed, not because it was all spent in
that affliction. The years are said to be 400 in round
numbers, although they were a little more,&mdash;whether you
reckon from this time, when these things were promised to
Abraham, or from the birth of Isaac, as the seed of Abraham,
of which these things are predicted. For, as we have already
said above, from the seventy-fifth year of Abraham, when the
first promise was made to him, down to the exodus of Israel
from Egypt, there are reckoned 430 years, which the apostle
thus mentions: "And this I say, that the covenant confirmed
by God, the law, which was made 430 years after, cannot
disannul, that it should make the promise of none effect."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a>
So then these 430 years might be called 400, because
they are not much more, especially since part even of that
number had already gone by when these things were shown
and said to Abraham in vision, or when Isaac was born in
his father's 100th year, twenty-five years after the first
promise, when of these 430 years there now remained 405,
which God was pleased to call 400. No one will doubt that
the other things which follow in the prophetic words of God
pertain to the people of Israel.</p>

<p>When it is added, "And when the sun was now setting
there was a flame, and lo, a smoking furnace, and lamps of
fire, which passed through between those pieces," this signifies
that at the end of the world the carnal shall be judged by
fire. For just as the affliction of the city of God, such as
never was before, which is expected to take place under Antichrist,
was signified by Abraham's horror of great darkness
about the going down of the sun, that is, when the end of
the world draws nigh,&mdash;so at the going down of the sun, that
is, at the very end of the world, there is signified by that fire
the day of judgment, which separates the carnal who are to
be saved by fire from those who are to be condemned in the
fire. And then the covenant made with Abraham particularly
sets forth the land of Canaan, and names eleven tribes in it
from the river of Egypt even to the great river Euphrates.
It is not then from the great river of Egypt, that is, the Nile,
but from a small one which separates Egypt from Palestine,
where the city of Rhinocorura is.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>Of Sarah's handmaid, Hagar, whom she herself wished to be Abraham's
concubine.</i></p>

<p>And here follow the times of Abraham's sons, the one by
Hagar the bond maid, the other by Sarah the free woman,
about whom we have already spoken in the previous book.
As regards this transaction, Abraham is in no way to be
branded as guilty concerning this concubine, for he used
her for the begetting of progeny, not for the gratification of
lust; and not to insult, but rather to obey his wife, who supposed
it would be a solace of her barrenness if she could
make use of the fruitful womb of her handmaid to supply
the defect of her own nature, and by that law of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
the apostle says, "Likewise also the husband hath not power
of his own body, but the wife,"<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> could, as a wife, make use
of him for childbearing by another, when she could not
do so in her own person. Here there is no wanton lust,
no filthy lewdness. The handmaid is delivered to the husband
by the wife for the sake of progeny, and is received
by the husband for the sake of progeny, each seeking, not
guilty excess, but natural fruit. And when the pregnant
bond woman despised her barren mistress, and Sarah, with
womanly jealousy, rather laid the blame of this on her
husband, even then Abraham showed that he was not a
slavish lover, but a free begetter of children, and that in
using Hagar he had guarded the chastity of Sarah his wife,
and had gratified her will and not his own,&mdash;had received her
without seeking, had gone in to her without being attached,
had impregnated without loving her,&mdash;for he says, "Behold
thy maid is in thy hands: do to her as it pleaseth thee;"<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a>
a man able to use women as a man should,&mdash;his wife temperately,
his handmaid compliantly, neither intemperately!</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>26. <i>Of God's attestation to Abraham, by which He assures him, when now old,
of a son by the barren Sarah, and appoints him the father of the nations,
and seals his faith in the promise by the sacrament of circumcision.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>After these things Ishmael was born of Hagar; and Abraham
might think that in him was fulfilled what God had promised
him, saying, when he wished to adopt his home-born servant,
"This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth
of thee, he shall be thine heir."<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> Therefore, lest he should
think that what was promised was fulfilled in the handmaid's
son, "when Abram was ninety years old and nine, God
appeared to him, and said unto him, I am God; be well-pleasing
in my sight, and be without complaint, and I will
make my covenant between me and thee, and will fill thee
exceedingly."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a></p>

<p>Here there are more distinct promises about the calling of
the nations in Isaac, that is, in the son of the promise, by
which grace is signified, and not nature; for the son is promised
from an old man and a barren old woman. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
although God effects even the natural course of procreation,
yet where the agency of God is manifest, through the decay
or failure of nature, grace is more plainly discerned. And
because this was to be brought about, not by generation, but
by regeneration, circumcision was enjoined now, when a son
was promised of Sarah. And by ordering all, not only sons,
but also home-born and purchased servants to be circumcised,
he testifies that this grace pertains to all. For what else does
circumcision signify than a nature renewed on the putting off
of the old? And what else does the eighth day mean than
Christ, who rose again when the week was completed, that is,
after the Sabbath? The very names of the parents are
changed: all things proclaim newness, and the new covenant
is shadowed forth in the old. For what does the term old
covenant imply but the concealing of the new? And what
does the term new covenant imply but the revealing of the
old? The laughter of Abraham is the exultation of one who
rejoices, not the scornful laughter of one who mistrusts. And
those words of his in his heart, "Shall a son be born to me
that am an hundred years old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety
years old, bear?" are not the words of doubt, but of wonder.
And when it is said, "And I will give to thee, and to thy
seed after thee, the land in which thou art a stranger, all the
land of Canaan, for an everlasting possession," if it troubles
any one whether this is to be held as fulfilled, or whether its
fulfilment may still be looked for, since no kind of earthly
possession can be everlasting for any nation whatever, let him
know that the word translated everlasting by our writers
is what the Greeks term &#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;, which is derived from &#945;&#7984;&#8060;&#957;,
the Greek for <i>s√¶culum</i>, an age. But the Latins have not
ventured to translate this by <i>secular</i>, lest they should change
the meaning into something widely different. For many
things are called secular which so happen in this world as to
pass away even in a short time; but what is termed &#945;&#7984;&#8061;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957;
either has no end, or lasts to the very end of this world.</p>

have not taken care to circumcise him. But even the infants,

accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators,"<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> except
that all who are held liable for any sin are accused of dealing
deceitfully (prevaricating) with some law? If on this
account, then, even the infants are, according to the true belief,
born in sin, not actual but original, so that we confess
they have need of grace for the remission of sins, certainly it
must be acknowledged that in the same sense in which they
are sinners they are also prevaricators of that law which was
given in Paradise, according to the truth of both scriptures,
"I accounted all the sinners of the earth prevaricators," and
"Where no law is, there is no prevarication." And thus, because
circumcision was the sign of regeneration, and the infant,
on account of the original sin by which God's covenant
was first broken, was not undeservedly to lose his generation
unless delivered by regeneration, these divine words are to be
understood as if it had been said, Whoever is not born again,
that soul shall perish from his people, because he hath broken
my covenant, since he also has sinned in Adam with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
others. For had He said, Because he hath broken this my
covenant, He would have compelled us to understand by it
only this of circumcision; but since He has not expressly said
what covenant the infant has broken, we are free to understand
Him as speaking of that covenant of which the breach
can be ascribed to an infant. Yet if any one contends that
it is said of nothing else than circumcision, that in it the
infant has broken the covenant of God because he is not circumcised,
he must seek some method of explanation by which
it may be understood without absurdity (such as this) that
he has broken the covenant, because it has been broken in
him although not by him. Yet in this case also it is to be
observed that the soul of the infant, being guilty of no sin of
neglect against itself, would perish unjustly, unless original
sin rendered it obnoxious to punishment.</p>

<p>28. <i>Of the change of name in Abraham and Sarah, who received the gift of
fecundity when they were incapable of regeneration owing to the barrenness
of one, and the old age of both.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Now when a promise so great and clear was made to
Abraham, in which it was so plainly said to him, "I have made
thee a father of many nations, and I will increase thee exceedingly,
and I will make nations of thee, and kings shall
go forth of thee. And I will give thee a son of Sarah; and I
will bless him, and he shall become nations, and kings of
nations shall be of him,"<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a>&mdash;a promise which we now see fulfilled
in Christ,&mdash;from that time forward this couple are not
called in Scripture, as formerly, Abram and Sarai, but Abraham
and Sarah, as we have called them from the first, for
every one does so now. The reason why the name of
Abraham was changed is given: "For," He says, "I have
made thee a father of many nations." This, then, is to be
understood to be the meaning of <i>Abraham</i>; but <i>Abram</i>, as he
was formerly called, means "exalted father." The reason of
the change of Sarah's name is not given; but as those say
who have written interpretations of the Hebrew names contained
in these books, Sarah means "my princess," and Sarai
"strength." Whence it is written in the Epistle to the
Hebrews, "Through faith also Sarah herself received strength<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
to conceive seed."<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> For both were old, as the Scripture
testifies; but she was also barren, and had ceased to menstruate,
so that she could no longer bear children even if she
had not been barren. Further, if a woman is advanced in
years, yet still retains the custom of women, she can bear
children to a young man, but not to an old man, although that
same old man can beget, but only of a young woman; as
after Sarah's death Abraham could of Keturah, because he
met with her in her lively age. This, then, is what the
apostle mentions as wonderful, saying, besides, that Abraham's
body was now dead;<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> because at that age he was no longer
able to beget children of any woman who retained now only
a small part of her natural vigour. Of course we must understand
that his body was dead only to some purposes, not to
all; for if it was so to all, it would no longer be the aged
body of a living man, but the corpse of a dead one. Although
that question, how Abraham begot children of Keturah,
is usually solved in this way, that the gift of begetting which
he received from the Lord, remained even after the death of
his wife, yet I think that solution of the question which I
have followed is preferable, because, although in our days an
old man of a hundred years can beget children of no woman,
it was not so then, when men still lived so long that a hundred
years did not yet bring on them the decrepitude of old age.</p>


<p class="center">29. <i>Of the three men or angels, in whom the Lord is related to have appeared
to Abraham at the oak of Mamre.</i></p>

<p>God appeared again to Abraham at the oak of Mamre in
three men, who it is not to be doubted were angels, although
some think that one of them was Christ, and assert that He
was visible before He put on flesh. Now it belongs to the
divine power, and invisible, incorporeal, and incommutable
nature, without changing itself at all, to appear even to mortal
men, not by what it is, but by what is subject to it. And
what is not subject to it? Yet if they try to establish that
one of these three was Christ by the fact that, although he
saw three, he addressed the Lord in the singular, as it is
written, "And, lo, three men stood by him: and, when he
saw them, he ran to meet them from the tent-door, and worshipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
toward the ground, and said, Lord, if I have found
favour before thee,"<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> etc.; why do they not advert to this
also, that when two of them came to destroy the Sodomites,
while Abraham still spoke to one, calling him Lord, and interceding
that he would not destroy the righteous along with
the wicked in Sodom, Lot received these two in such a way
that he too in his conversation with them addressed the Lord
in the singular? For after saying to them in the plural,
"Behold, my lords, turn aside into your servant's house,"<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> etc.,
yet it is afterwards said, "And the angels laid hold upon his
hand, and the hand of his wife, and the hands of his two
daughters, because the Lord was merciful unto him. And it
came to pass, whenever they had led him forth abroad, that
they said, Save thy life; look not behind thee, neither stay
thou in all this region: save thyself in the mountain, lest
thou be caught. And Lot said unto them, I pray thee, Lord,
since thy servant hath found grace in thy sight,"<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> etc. And
then after these words the Lord also answered him in the
singular, although He was in two angels, saying, "See, I have
accepted thy face,"<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> etc. This makes it much more credible that
both Abraham in the three men and Lot in the two recognised
the Lord, addressing Him in the singular number, even when
they were addressing men; for they received them as they did
for no other reason than that they might minister human refection
to them as men who needed it. Yet there was about them
something so excellent, that those who showed them hospitality
as men could not doubt that God was in them as He
was wont to be in the prophets, and therefore sometimes
addressed them in the plural, and sometimes God in them in
the singular. But that they were angels the Scripture
testifies, not only in this book of Genesis, in which these
transactions are related, but also in the Epistle to the Hebrews,
where in praising hospitality it is said, "For thereby some
have entertained angels unawares."<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> By these three men,
then, when a son Isaac was again promised to Abraham by
Sarah, such a divine oracle was also given that it was said,
"Abraham shall become a great and numerous nation, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> And here
these two things are promised with the utmost brevity and
fulness,&mdash;the nation of Israel according to the flesh, and all
nations according to faith.</p>


<p class="center">30. <i>Of Lot's deliverance from Sodom, and its consumption by fire from heaven;
and of Abimelech, whose lust could not harm Sarah's chastity.</i></p>

<p>After this promise Lot was delivered out of Sodom, and a
fiery rain from heaven turned into ashes that whole region of
the impious city, where custom had made sodomy as prevalent
as laws have elsewhere made other kinds of wickedness. But
this punishment of theirs was a specimen of the divine judgment
to come. For what is meant by the angels forbidding
those who were delivered to look back, but that we are not
to look back in heart to the old life which, being regenerated
through grace, we have put off, if we think to escape the last
judgment? Lot's wife, indeed, when she looked back, remained,
and, being turned into salt, furnished to believing
men a condiment by which to savour somewhat the warning
to be drawn from that example. Then Abraham did again
at Gerar, with Abimelech the king of that city, what he had
done in Egypt about his wife, and received her back untouched
in the same way. On this occasion, when the king
rebuked Abraham for not saying she was his wife, and calling
her his sister, he explained what he had been afraid of, and
added this further, "And yet indeed she is my sister by the
father's side, but not by the mother's;"<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> for she was Abraham's
sister by his own father, and so near of kin. But her beauty
was so great, that even at that advanced age she could be
fallen in love with.</p>


<p class="center">31. <i>Of Isaac, who was born according to the promise, whose name was given on
account of the laughter of both parents.</i></p>

<p>After these things a son was born to Abraham, according
to God's promise, of Sarah, and was called Isaac, which means
<i>laughter</i>. For his father had laughed when he was promised
to him, in wondering delight, and his mother, when he was
again promised by those three men, had laughed, doubting for
joy; yet she was blamed by the angel because that laughter,
although it was for joy, yet was not full of faith. Afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
she was confirmed in faith by the same angel. From this,
then, the boy got his name. For when Isaac was born and
called by that name, Sarah showed that her laughter was not
that of scornful reproach, but that of joyful praise; for she
said, "God hath made me to laugh, so that every one who
hears will laugh with me."<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> Then in a little while the
bond maid was cast out of the house with her son; and, according
to the apostle, these two women signify the old and new
covenants,&mdash;Sarah representing that of the Jerusalem which is
above, that is, the city of God.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>


<p class="center">32. <i>Of Abraham's obedience and faith, which were proved by the offering up of
his son in sacrifice; and of Sarah's death.</i></p>

<p>Among other things, of which it would take too long time
to mention the whole, Abraham was tempted about the offering
up of his well-beloved son Isaac, to prove his pious obedience,
and so make it known to the world, not to God. Now
every temptation is not blameworthy; it may even be praiseworthy,
because it furnishes probation. And, for the most
part, the human mind cannot attain to self-knowledge otherwise
than by making trial of its powers through temptation,
by some kind of experimental and not merely verbal self-interrogation;
when, if it has acknowledged the gift of God, it
is pious, and is consolidated by stedfast grace and not puffed
up by vain boasting. Of course Abraham could never believe
that God delighted in human sacrifices; yet when the divine
commandment thundered, it was to be obeyed, not disputed.
Yet Abraham is worthy of praise, because he all along
believed that his son, on being offered up, would rise again;
for God had said to him, when he was unwilling to fulfil his
wife's pleasure by casting out the bond maid and her son, "In
Isaac shall thy seed be called." No doubt He then goes on
to say, "And as for the son of this bond woman, I will make
him a great nation, because he is thy seed."<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> How then is
it said, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called," when God calls
Ishmael also his seed? The apostle, in explaining this, says,
"In Isaac shall thy seed be called, that is, they which are the
children of the flesh, these are not the children of God: but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the children of the promise are counted for the seed."<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> In
order, then, that the children of the promise may be the seed
of Abraham, they are called in Isaac, that is, are gathered
together in Christ by the call of grace. Therefore the father,
holding fast from the first the promise which behoved to be
fulfilled through this son whom God had ordered him to slay,
did not doubt that he whom he once thought it hopeless he
should ever receive would be restored to him when he had
offered him up. It is in this way the passage in the Epistle
to the Hebrews is also to be understood and explained. "By
faith," he says, "Abraham overcame, when tempted about
Isaac: and he who had received the promise offered up his
only son, to whom it was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be
called: thinking that God was able to raise him up, even
from the dead;" therefore he has added, "from whence also
he received him in a similitude."<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> In whose similitude but
His of whom the apostle says, "He that spared not His own
Son, but delivered Him up for us all?"<a name="FNanchor_306_306" id="FNanchor_306_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> And on this
account Isaac also himself carried to the place of sacrifice the
wood on which he was to be offered up, just as the Lord
Himself carried His own cross. Finally, since Isaac was not
to be slain, after his father was forbidden to smite him, who
was that ram by the offering of which that sacrifice was completed
with typical blood? For when Abraham saw him, he
was caught by the horns in a thicket. What, then, did he
represent but Jesus, who, before He was offered up, was
crowned with thorns by the Jews?</p>

<p>But let us rather hear the divine words spoken through
the angel. For the Scripture says, "And Abraham stretched
forth his hand to take the knife, that he might slay his son.
And the Angel of the Lord called unto him from heaven, and
said, Abraham. And he said, Here am I. And he said, Lay
not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou anything unto
him: for now I know that thou fearest God, and hast not
spared thy beloved son for my sake."<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> It is said, "Now I
know," that is, Now I have made to be known; for God was not
previously ignorant of this. Then, having offered up that ram<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
instead of Isaac his son, "Abraham," as we read, "called the
name of that place The Lord seeth: as they say this day, In
the mount the Lord hath appeared."<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> As it is said, "Now I
know," for Now I have made to be known, so here, "The
Lord sees," for The Lord hath appeared, that is, made Himself
to be seen. "And the Angel of the Lord called unto Abraham
from heaven the second time, saying, By myself have I sworn,
saith the Lord; because thou hast done this thing, and hast
not spared thy beloved son for my sake; that in blessing I
will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed
as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea-shore;
and thy seed shall possess by inheritance the cities of
the adversaries: and in thy seed shall all the nations of the
earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice."<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> In
this manner is that promise concerning the calling of the
nations in the seed of Abraham confirmed even by the oath
of God, after that burnt-offering which typified Christ. For
He had often promised, but never sworn. And what is the
oath of God, the true and faithful, but a confirmation of the
promise, and a certain reproof to the unbelieving?</p>

<p>After these things Sarah died, in the 127th year of her life,
and the 137th of her husband; for he was ten years older
than she, as he himself says, when a son is promised to him
by her: "Shall a son be born to me that am an hundred years
old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?"<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Then
Abraham bought a field, in which he buried his wife. And
then, according to Stephen's account, he was settled in that
land, entering then on actual possession of it,&mdash;that is, after
the death of his father, who is inferred to have died two years
before.</p>


<p class="center">33. <i>Of Rebecca, the grand-daughter of Nahor, whom Isaac took to wife.</i></p>

<p>Isaac married Rebecca, the grand-daughter of Nahor, his
father's brother, when he was forty years old, that is, in the
140th year of his father's life, three years after his mother's
death. Now when a servant was sent to Mesopotamia by his
father to fetch her, and when Abraham said to that servant,
"Put thy hand under my thigh, and I will make thee swear
by the Lord, the God of heaven, and the Lord of the earth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
that thou shalt not take a wife unto my son Isaac of the
daughters of the Canaanites,"<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> what else was pointed out by
this, but that the Lord, the God of heaven, and the Lord of
the earth, was to come in the flesh which was to be derived
from that thigh? Are these small tokens of the foretold
truth which we see fulfilled in Christ?</p>


<p class="center">34. <i>What is meant by Abraham's marrying Keturah after Sarah's death.</i></p>

<p>What did Abraham mean by marrying Keturah after
Sarah's death? Far be it from us to suspect him of incontinence,
especially when he had reached such an age and such
sanctity of faith. Or was he still seeking to beget children,
though he held fast, with most approved faith, the promise
of God that his children should be multiplied out of Isaac as
the stars of heaven and the dust of the earth? And yet, if
Hagar and Ishmael, as the apostle teaches us, signified the
carnal people of the old covenant, why may not Keturah and
her sons also signify the carnal people who think they belong
to the new covenant? For both are called both the wives
and the concubines of Abraham; but Sarah is never called a
concubine (but only a wife). For when Hagar is given to
Abraham, it is written, "And Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar
the Egyptian, her handmaid, after Abram had dwelt ten years
in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abram
to be his wife."<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> And of Keturah, whom he took after
Sarah's departure, we read, "Then again Abraham took a
wife, whose name was Keturah."<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> Lo, both are called wives,
yet both are found to have been concubines; for the Scripture
afterward says, "And Abraham gave his whole estate
unto Isaac his son. But unto the sons of his concubines
Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from his son Isaac,
(while he yet lived,) eastward, unto the east country."<a name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Therefore
the sons of the concubines, that is, the heretics and the
carnal Jews, have some gifts, but do not attain the promised
kingdom; "For they which are the children of the flesh, these
are not the children of God: but the children of the promise
are counted for the seed, of whom it was said, In Isaac shall
thy seed be called."<a name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> For I do not see why Keturah, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
was married after the wife's death, should be called a concubine,
except on account of this mystery. But if any one is
unwilling to put such meanings on these things, he need not
calumniate Abraham. For what if even this was provided
against the heretics who were to be the opponents of second
marriages, so that it might be shown that it was no sin in the
case of the father of many nations himself, when, after his
wife's death, he married again? And Abraham died when
he was 175 years old, so that he left his son Isaac seventy-five
years old, having begotten him when 100 years old.</p>


<p class="center">35. <i>What was indicated by the divine answer about the twins still shut up in the
womb of Rebecca their mother.</i></p>

<p>Let us now see how the times of the city of God run on
from this point among Abraham's descendants. In the time
from the first year of Isaac's life to the seventieth, when his
sons were born, the only memorable thing is, that when he
prayed God that his wife, who was barren, might bear, and
the Lord granted what he sought, and she conceived, the
twins leapt while still enclosed in her womb. And when she
was troubled by this struggle, and inquired of the Lord, she
received this answer: "Two nations are in thy womb, and two
manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and the
one people shall overcome the other people, and the elder
shall serve the younger."<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id="FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> The Apostle Paul would have us
understand this as a great instance of grace;<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> for the children
being not yet born, neither having done any good or evil, the
younger is chosen without any good desert, and the elder is
rejected, when beyond doubt, as regards original sin, both
were alike, and as regards actual sin, neither had any. But
the plan of the work on hand does not permit me to speak
more fully of this matter now, and I have said much about it
in other works. Only that saying, "The elder shall serve the
younger," is understood by our writers, almost without exception,
to mean that the elder people, the Jews, shall serve the
younger people, the Christians. And truly, although this
might seem to be fulfilled in the Idumean nation, which was
born of the elder (who had two names, being called both Esau
and Edom, whence the name Idumeans), because it was afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
to be overcome by the people which sprang from the
younger, that is, by the Israelites, and was to become subject
to them; yet it is more suitable to believe that, when it
was said, "The one people shall overcome the other people,
and the elder shall serve the younger," that prophecy meant
some greater thing; and what is that except what is evidently
fulfilled in the Jews and Christians?</p>


<p class="center">36. <i>Of the oracle and blessing which Isaac received, just as his father did, being
beloved for his sake.</i></p>

<p>Isaac also received such an oracle as his father had often
received. Of this oracle it is thus written: "And there was
a famine over the land, beside the first famine that was in
the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech
king of the Philistines unto Gerar. And the Lord appeared
unto him, and said, Go not down into Egypt; but dwell in
the land which I shall tell thee of. And abide in this land,
and I will be with thee, and will bless thee: unto thee and
unto thy seed I will give all this land; and I will establish
mine oath, which I sware unto Abraham thy father: and I
will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and will give
unto thy seed all this land: and in thy seed shall all the
nations of the earth be blessed; because that Abraham thy
father obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts, my commandments,
my righteousness, and my laws."<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> This patriarch
neither had another wife, nor any concubine, but was content
with the twin-children begotten by one act of generation.
He also was afraid, when he lived among strangers, of being
brought into danger owing to the beauty of his wife, and did
like his father in calling her his sister, and not telling that
she was his wife; for she was his near blood-relation by the
father's and mother's side. She also remained untouched by
the strangers, when it was known she was his wife. Yet we
ought not to prefer him to his father because he knew no
woman besides his one wife. For beyond doubt the merits
of his father's faith and obedience were greater, inasmuch as
God says it is for his sake He does Isaac good: "In thy seed,"
He says, "shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because
that Abraham thy father obeyed my voice, and kept my precepts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
my commandments, my statutes, and my laws." And
again in another oracle He says, "I am the God of Abraham
thy father: fear not, for I am with thee, and will bless thee,
and multiply thy seed for my servant Abraham's sake."<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> So
that we must understand how chastely Abraham acted, because
imprudent men, who seek some support for their own
wickedness in the Holy Scriptures, think he acted through
lust. We may also learn this, not to compare men by single
good things, but to consider everything in each; for it may
happen that one man has something in his life and character
in which he excels another, and it may be far more excellent
than that in which the other excels him. And thus, according
to sound and true judgment, while continence is preferable
to marriage, yet a believing married man is better than
a continent unbeliever; for the unbeliever is not only less
praiseworthy, but is even highly detestable. We must conclude,
then, that both are good; yet so as to hold that the
married man who is most faithful and most obedient is certainly
better than the continent man whose faith and obedience
are less. But if equal in other things, who would hesitate to
prefer the continent man to the married?</p>


<p class="center">37. <i>Of the things mystically prefigured in Esau and Jacob.</i></p>

<p>Isaac's two sons, Esau and Jacob, grew up together. The
primacy of the elder was transferred to the younger by a
bargain and agreement between them, when the elder immoderately
lusted after the lentiles the younger had prepared
for food, and for that price sold his birthright to him,
confirming it with an oath. We learn from this that a person
is to be blamed, not for the kind of food he eats, but for
immoderate greed. Isaac grew old, and old age deprived him
of his eyesight. He wished to bless the elder son, and
instead of the elder, who was hairy, unwittingly blessed the
younger, who put himself under his father's hands, having
covered himself with kid-skins, as if bearing the sins of others.
Lest we should think this guile of Jacob's was fraudulent
guile, instead of seeking in it the mystery of a great thing,
the Scripture has predicted in the words just before, "Esau<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
was a cunning hunter, a man of the field; and Jacob was a
simple man, dwelling at home."<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Some of our writers have
interpreted this, "without guile." But whether the Greek
&#7940;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962; means "without guile," or "simple," or rather
"without feigning," in the receiving of that blessing what is
the guile of the man without guile? What is the guile of
the simple, what the fiction of the man who does not lie, but
a profound mystery of the truth? But what is the blessing
itself? "See," he says, "the smell of my son is as the smell
of a full field which the Lord hath blessed: therefore God
give thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fruitfulness of the
earth, and plenty of corn and wine: let nations serve thee,
and princes adore thee: and be lord of thy brethren, and let thy
father's sons adore thee: cursed be he that curseth thee, and
blessed be he that blesseth thee."<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> The blessing of Jacob is
therefore a proclamation of Christ to all nations. It is this
which has come to pass, and is now being fulfilled. Isaac is
the law and the prophecy: even by the mouth of the Jews
Christ is blessed by prophecy as by one who knows not, because
it is itself not understood. The world like a field is filled
with the odour of Christ's name: His is the blessing of the dew
of heaven, that is, of the showers of divine words; and of
the fruitfulness of the earth, that is, of the gathering together
of the peoples: His is the plenty of corn and wine, that is,
the multitude that gathers bread and wine in the sacrament of
His body and blood. Him the nations serve, Him princes
adore. He is the Lord of His brethren, because His people
rules over the Jews. Him His Father's sons adore, that is,
the sons of Abraham according to faith; for He Himself is
the son of Abraham according to the flesh. He is cursed
that curseth Him, and he that blesseth Him is blessed.
Christ, I say, who is ours is blessed, that is, truly spoken of out
of the mouths of the Jews, when, although erring, they yet
sing the law and the prophets, and think they are blessing
another for whom they erringly hope. So, when the elder
son claims the promised blessing, Isaac is greatly afraid, and
wonders when he knows that he has blessed one instead of the
other, and demands who he is; yet he does not complain that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
he has been deceived, yea, when the great mystery is revealed
to him, in his secret heart he at once eschews anger,
and confirms the blessing. "Who then," he says, "hath
hunted me venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of
all before thou camest, and have blessed him, and he shall be
blessed?"<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> Who would not rather have expected the curse
of an angry man here, if these things had been done in an
earthly manner, and not by inspiration from above? O
things done, yet done prophetically; on the earth, yet celestially;
by men, yet divinely! If everything that is fertile of
so great mysteries should be examined carefully, many volumes
would be filled; but the moderate compass fixed for this work
compels us to hasten to other things.</p>

<p>38. <i>Of Jacob's mission to Mesopotamia to get a wife, and of the vision which he
saw in a dream by the way, and of his getting four women when he
sought one wife.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Jacob was sent by his parents to Mesopotamia that he
might take a wife there. These were his father's words on
sending him: "Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters
of the Canaanites. Arise, fly to Mesopotamia, to the house of
Bethuel, thy mother's father, and take thee a wife from thence
of the daughters of Laban thy mother's brother. And my
God bless thee, and increase thee, and multiply thee; and
thou shalt be an assembly of peoples; and give to thee the
blessing of Abraham thy father, and to thy seed after thee;
that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou dwellest,
which God gave unto Abraham."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Now we understand here
that the seed of Jacob is separated from Isaac's other seed
which came through Esau. For when it is said, "In Isaac
shall thy seed be called,"<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> by this seed is meant solely the
city of God; so that from it is separated Abraham's other
seed, which was in the son of the bond woman, and which was
to be in the sons of Keturah. But until now it had been
uncertain regarding Isaac's twin-sons whether that blessing
belonged to both or only to one of them; and if to one,
which of them it was. This is now declared when Jacob is
prophetically blessed by his father, and it is said to him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
"And thou shalt be an assembly of peoples, and God give to
thee the blessing of Abraham thy father."</p>

<p>When Jacob was going to Mesopotamia, he received in a
dream an oracle, of which it is thus written: "And Jacob went
out from the well of the oath,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> and went to Haran. And he came
to a place, and slept there, for the sun was set; and he took of
the stones of the place, and put them at his head, and slept in
that place, and dreamed. And behold a ladder set up on the
earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and the angels of
God ascended and descended by it. And the Lord stood
above it, and said, I am the God of Abraham thy father, and
the God of Isaac; fear not: the land whereon thou sleepest,
to thee will I give it, and to thy seed; and thy seed shall be
as the dust of the earth; and it shall be spread abroad to the
sea, and to Africa, and to the north, and to the east: and all
the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in thee and in thy
seed. And, behold, I am with thee, to keep thee in all thy
way wherever thou goest, and I will bring thee back into
this land; for I will not leave thee, until I have done all
which I have spoken to thee of. And Jacob awoke out of
his sleep, and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I
knew it not. And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is
this place! this is none other but the house of God, and this
is the gate of heaven. And Jacob arose, and took the stone
that he had put under his head there, and set it up for a
memorial, and poured oil upon the top of it. And Jacob
called the name of that place the house of God."<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> This is
prophetic. For Jacob did not pour oil on the stone in an
idolatrous way, as if making it a god; neither did he adore
that stone, or sacrifice to it. But since the name of Christ
comes from the chrism or anointing, something pertaining to
the great mystery was certainly represented in this. And
the Saviour Himself is understood to bring this latter to
remembrance in the gospel, when He says of Nathanael,
"Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> because
Israel who saw this vision is no other than Jacob. And in
the same place He says, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and
descending upon the Son of man."</p>

<p>Jacob went on to Mesopotamia to take a wife from thence.
And the divine Scripture points out how, without unlawfully
desiring any of them, he came to have four women, of
whom he begat twelve sons and one daughter; for he had
come to take only one. But when one was falsely given him
in place of the other, he did not send her away after unwittingly
using her in the night, lest he should seem to have
put her to shame; but as at that time, in order to multiply
posterity, no law forbade a plurality of wives, he took her also
to whom alone he had promised marriage. As she was barren,
she gave her handmaid to her husband that she might have
children by her; and her elder sister did the same thing in
imitation of her, although she had borne, because she desired
to multiply progeny. We do not read that Jacob sought any
but one, or that he used many, except for the purpose of begetting
offspring, saving conjugal rights; and he would not
have done this, had not his wives, who had legitimate power
over their own husband's body, urged him to do it. So he
begat twelve sons and one daughter by four women. Then
he entered into Egypt by his son Joseph, who was sold by his
brethren for envy, and carried there, and who was there exalted.</p>


<p class="center">39. <i>The reason why Jacob was also called Israel.</i></p>

<p>As I said a little ago, Jacob was also called Israel, the
name which was most prevalent among the people descended
from him. Now this name was given him by the angel
who wrestled with him on the way back from Mesopotamia,
and who was most evidently a type of Christ. For when
Jacob overcame him, doubtless with his own consent, that the
mystery might be represented, it signified Christ's passion, in
which the Jews are seen overcoming Him. And yet he
besought a blessing from the very angel he had overcome; and
so the imposition of this name was the blessing. For Israel
means <i>seeing God</i>,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> which will at last be the reward of all the
saints. The angel also touched him on the breadth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
thigh when he was overcoming him, and in that way made
him lame. So that Jacob was at one and the same time
blessed and lame: blessed in those among that people who
believed in Christ, and lame in the unbelieving. For the
breadth of the thigh is the multitude of the family. For there
are many of that race of whom it was prophetically said beforehand,
"And they have halted in their paths."<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>


<p class="center">40. <i>How it is said that Jacob went into Egypt with seventy-five souls, when most
of those who are mentioned were born at a later period.</i></p>

<p>Seventy-five men are reported to have entered Egypt along
with Jacob, counting him with his children. In this number
only two women are mentioned, one a daughter, the other a
grand-daughter. But when the thing is carefully considered,
it does not appear that Jacob's offspring was so numerous on the
day or year when he entered Egypt. There are also included
among them the great-grandchildren of Joseph, who could not
possibly be born already. For Jacob was then 130 years old,
and his son Joseph thirty-nine; and as it is plain that he
took a wife when he was thirty or more, how could he in nine
years have great-grandchildren by the children whom he had
by that wife? Now, since Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons
of Joseph, could not even have children, for Jacob found them
boys under nine years old when he entered Egypt, in what
way are not only their sons but their grandsons reckoned
among those seventy-five who then entered Egypt with Jacob?
For there is reckoned there Machir the son of Manasseh, grandson
of Joseph, and Machir's son, that is, Gilead, grandson of
Manasseh, great-grandson of Joseph; there, too, is he whom
Ephraim, Joseph's other son, begot, that is, Shuthelah, grandson
of Joseph, and Shuthelah's son Ezer, grandson of Ephraim,
and great-grandson of Joseph, who could not possibly be in
existence when Jacob came into Egypt, and there found his
grandsons, the sons of Joseph, their grandsires, still boys under
nine years of age.<a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> But doubtless, when the Scripture mentions
Jacob's entrance into Egypt with seventy-five souls, it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
not mean one day, or one year, but that whole time as long as
Joseph lived, who was the cause of his entrance. For the
same Scripture speaks thus of Joseph: "And Joseph dwelt
in Egypt, he and his brethren, and all his father's house: and
Joseph lived 110 years, and saw Ephraim's children of the
third generation."<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> That is, his great-grandson, the third from
Ephraim; for the third generation means son, grandson, great-grandson.
Then it is added, "The children also of Machir,
the son of Manasseh, were born upon Joseph's knees."<a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> And
this is that grandson of Manasseh, and great-grandson of
Joseph. But the plural number is employed according to
scriptural usage; for the one daughter of Jacob is spoken of
as daughters, just as in the usage of the Latin tongue <i>liberi</i> is
used in the plural for children even when there is only one.
Now, when Joseph's own happiness is proclaimed, because he
could see his great-grandchildren, it is by no means to be
thought they already existed in the thirty-ninth year of their
great-grandsire Joseph, when his father Jacob came to him in
Egypt. But those who diligently look into these things will
the less easily be mistaken, because it is written, "These are
the names of the sons of Israel who entered into Egypt along
with Jacob their father."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> For this means that the seventy-five
are reckoned along with him, not that they were all with
him when he entered Egypt; for, as I have said, the whole
period during which Joseph, who occasioned his entrance, lived,
is held to be the time of that entrance.</p>


<p class="center">41. <i>Of the blessing which Jacob promised in Judah his son.</i></p>

<p>If, on account of the Christian people in whom the city of
God sojourns in the earth, we look for the flesh of Christ in
the seed of Abraham, setting aside the sons of the concubines,
we have Isaac; if in the seed of Isaac, setting aside Esau,
who is also Edom, we have Jacob, who also is Israel; if in
the seed of Israel himself, setting aside the rest, we have
Judah, because Christ sprang of the tribe of Judah. Let us
hear, then, how Israel, when dying in Egypt, in blessing his
sons, prophetically blessed Judah. He says: "Judah, thy
brethren shall praise thee: thy hands shall be on the back of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
thine enemies; thy father's children shall adore thee. Judah
is a lion's whelp: from the sprouting, my son, thou art gone
up: lying down, thou hast slept as a lion, and as a lion's
whelp; who shall awake him? A prince shall not be
lacking out of Judah, and a leader from his thighs, until the
things come that are laid up for him; and He shall be the
expectation of the nations. Binding his foal unto the vine,
and his ass's foal to the choice vine; he shall wash his robe
in wine, and his clothes in the blood of the grape: his eyes
are red with wine, and his teeth are whiter than milk."<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> I
have expounded these words in disputing against Faustus the
Manich√¶an; and I think it is enough to make the truth of
this prophecy shine, to remark that the death of Christ is predicted
by the word about his lying down, and not the necessity,
but the voluntary character of His death, in the title of
lion. That power He Himself proclaims in the gospel, saying,
"I have the power of laying down my life, and I have the
power of taking it again. No man taketh it from me; but I
lay it down of myself, and take it again."<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> So the lion roared,
so He fulfilled what He said. For to this power what is added
about the resurrection refers, "Who shall awake him?" This
means that no man but Himself has raised Him, who also
said of His own body, "Destroy this temple, and in three
days I will raise it up."<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> And the very nature of His death,
that is, the height of the cross, is understood by the single
word, "Thou art gone up." The evangelist explains what is
added, "Lying down, thou hast slept," when he says, "He
bowed His head, and gave up the ghost."<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> Or at least His
burial is to be understood, in which He lay down sleeping,
and whence no man raised Him, as the prophets did some,
and as He Himself did others; but He Himself rose up as if
from sleep. As for His robe which He washes in wine, that
is, cleanses from sin in His own blood, of which blood those
who are baptized know the mystery, so that he adds, "And
his clothes in the blood of the grape," what is it but the
Church? "And his eyes are red with wine," [these are] His
spiritual people drunken with His cup, of which the psalm
sings, "And thy cup that makes drunken, how excellent it is!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
"And his teeth are whiter than milk,"<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a>&mdash;that is, the nutritive
words which, according to the apostle, the babes drink, being
as yet unfit for solid food.<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> And it is He in whom the promises
of Judah were laid up, so that until they come, princes,
that is, the kings of Israel, shall never be lacking out of Judah.
"And He is the expectation of the nations." This is too plain
to need exposition.</p>


<p class="center">42. <i>Of the sons of Joseph, whom Jacob blessed, prophetically changing his hands.</i></p>

<p>Now, as Isaac's two sons, Esau and Jacob, furnished a type
of the two people, the Jews and the Christians (although
as pertains to carnal descent it was not the Jews but the
Idumeans who came of the seed of Esau, nor the Christian
nations but rather the Jews who came of Jacob's; for the type
holds only as regards the saying, "The elder shall serve the
younger"<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>), so the same thing happened in Joseph's two sons;
for the elder was a type of the Jews, and the younger of the
Christians. For when Jacob was blessing them, and laid his
right hand on the younger, who was at his left, and his left
hand on the elder, who was at his right, this seemed wrong to
their father, and he admonished his father by trying to correct
his mistake and show him which was the elder. But he
would not change his hands, but said, "I know, my son, I
know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be
exalted; but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and
his seed shall become a multitude of nations."<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> And these
two promises show the same thing. For that one is to become
"a people;" this one "a multitude of nations." And what can
be more evident than that these two promises comprehend the
people of Israel, and the whole world of Abraham's seed, the
one according to the flesh, the other according to faith?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>43. <i>Of the times of Moses and Joshua the son of Nun, of the judges, and thereafter
of the kings, of whom Saul was the first, but David is to be regarded
as the chief, both by the oath and by merit.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Jacob being dead, and Joseph also, during the remaining
144 years until they went out of the land of Egypt that
nation increased to an incredible degree, even although wasted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
by so great persecutions, that at one time the male children
were murdered at their birth, because the wondering Egyptians
were terrified at the too great increase of that people. Then
Moses, being stealthily kept from the murderers of the infants,
was brought to the royal house, God preparing to do great
things by him, and was nursed and adopted by the daughter
of Pharaoh (that was the name of all the kings of Egypt), and
became so great a man that he&mdash;yea, rather God, who had promised
this to Abraham, by him&mdash;drew that nation, so wonderfully
multiplied, out of the yoke of hardest and most grievous
servitude it had borne there. At first, indeed, he fled thence
(we are told he fled into the land of Midian), because, in
defending an Israelite, he had slain an Egyptian, and was
afraid. Afterward, being divinely commissioned in the power
of the Spirit of God, he overcame the magi of Pharaoh who
resisted him. Then, when the Egyptians would not let God's
people go, ten memorable plagues were brought by Him upon
them,&mdash;the water turned into blood, the frogs and lice, the flies,
the death of the cattle, the boils, the hail, the locusts, the
darkness, the death of the first-born. At last the Egyptians
were destroyed in the Red Sea while pursuing the Israelites,
whom they had let go when at length they were broken by
so many great plagues. The divided sea made a way for the
Israelites who were departing, but, returning on itself, it overwhelmed
their pursuers with its waves. Then for forty years
the people of God went through the desert, under the leadership
of Moses, when the tabernacle of testimony was dedicated,
in which God was worshipped by sacrifices prophetic of things
to come, and that was after the law had been very terribly
given in the mount, for its divinity was most plainly attested
by wonderful signs and voices. This took place soon after the
exodus from Egypt, when the people had entered the desert,
on the fiftieth day after the passover was celebrated by the
offering up of a lamb, which is so completely a type of Christ,
foretelling that through His sacrificial passion He should go
from this world to the Father (for <i>pascha</i> in the Hebrew
tongue means <i>transit</i>), that when the new covenant was
revealed, after Christ our passover was offered up, the Holy
Spirit came from heaven on the fiftieth day; and He is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
in the gospel the Finger of God, because He recalls to our
remembrance the things done before by way of types, and
because the tables of that law are said to have been written
by the finger of God.</p>

<p>On the death of Moses, Joshua the son of Nun ruled the
people, and led them into the land of promise, and divided it
among them. By these two wonderful leaders wars were also
carried on most prosperously and wonderfully, God calling to
witness that they had got these victories not so much on
account of the merit of the Hebrew people as on account of
the sins of the nations they subdued. After these leaders
there were judges, when the people were settled in the land of
promise, so that, in the meantime, the first promise made to
Abraham began to be fulfilled about the one nation, that is,
the Hebrew, and about the land of Canaan; but not as yet
the promise about all nations, and the whole wide world, for
that was to be fulfilled, not by the observances of the old law,
but by the advent of Christ in the flesh, and by the faith of the
gospel. And it was to prefigure this that it was not Moses,
who received the law for the people on Mount Sinai, that led
the people into the land of promise, but Joshua, whose name
also was changed at God's command, so that he was called
Jesus. But in the times of the judges prosperity alternated
with adversity in war, according as the sins of the people and
the mercy of God were displayed.</p>

<p>We come next to the times of the kings. The first who
reigned was Saul; and when he was rejected and laid low in
battle, and his offspring rejected so that no kings should arise
out of it, David succeeded to the kingdom, whose son Christ
is chiefly called. He was made a kind of starting-point and
beginning of the advanced youth of God's people, who had
passed a kind of age of puberty from Abraham to this David.
And it is not in vain that the evangelist Matthew records the
generations in such a way as to sum up this first period from
Abraham to David in fourteen generations. For from the age
of puberty man begins to be capable of generation; therefore
he starts the list of generations from Abraham, who also was
made the father of many nations when he got his name
changed. So that previously this family of God's people was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
in its childhood, from Noah to Abraham; and for that reason
the first language was then learned, that is, the Hebrew. For
man begins to speak in childhood, the age succeeding infancy,
which is so termed because then he cannot speak.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> And
that first age is quite drowned in oblivion, just as the first age
of the human race was blotted out by the flood; for who is
there that can remember his infancy? Wherefore in this
progress of the city of God, as the previous book contained
that first age, so this one ought to contain the second and
third ages, in which third age, as was shown by the heifer of
three years old, the she-goat of three years old, and the ram
of three years old, the yoke of the law was imposed, and there
appeared abundance of sins, and the beginning of the earthly
kingdom arose, in which there were not lacking spiritual men,
of whom the turtle-dove and pigeon represented the mystery.</p>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>IN THIS BOOK THE HISTORY OF THE CITY OF GOD IS TRACED DURING THE PERIOD
OF THE KINGS AND PROPHETS FROM SAMUEL TO DAVID, EVEN TO CHRIST;
AND THE PROPHECIES WHICH ARE RECORDED IN THE BOOK OF KINGS,
PSALMS, AND THOSE OF SOLOMON, ARE INTERPRETED OF CHRIST AND THE
CHURCH.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>Of the prophetic age.</i></p>

<p>By the favour of God we have treated distinctly of His
promises made to Abraham, that both the nation of
Israel according to the flesh, and all nations according to faith,
should be his seed, and the City of God, proceeding according
to the order of time, will point<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> out how they were fulfilled.
Having therefore in the previous book come down to the reign
of David, we shall now treat of what remains, so far as may
seem sufficient for the object of this work, beginning at the
same reign. Now, from the time when holy Samuel began to
prophesy, and ever onward until the people of Israel was led
captive into Babylonia, and until, according to the prophecy
of holy Jeremiah, on Israel's return thence after seventy years,
the house of God was built anew, this whole period is the
prophetic age. For although both the patriarch Noah himself,
in whose days the whole earth was destroyed by the
flood, and others before and after him down to this time when
there began to be kings over the people of God, may not undeservedly
be styled prophets, on account of certain things
pertaining to the city of God and the kingdom of heaven,
which they either predicted or in any way signified should
come to pass, and especially since we read that some of them,
as Abraham and Moses, were expressly so styled, yet those
are most and chiefly called the days of the prophets from the
time when Samuel began to prophesy, who at God's command
first anointed Saul to be king, and, on his rejection, David
himself, whom others of his issue should succeed as long as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
was fitting they should do so. If, therefore, I wished to rehearse
all that the prophets have predicted concerning Christ,
while the city of God, with its members dying and being born
in constant succession, ran its course through those times, this
work would extend beyond all bounds. First, because the
Scripture itself, even when, in treating in order of the kings
and of their deeds and the events of their reigns, it seems to
be occupied in narrating as with historical diligence the affairs
transacted, will be found, if the things handled by it are considered
with the aid of the Spirit of God, either more, or
certainly not less, intent on foretelling things to come than on
relating things past. And who that thinks even a little about
it does not know how laborious and prolix a work it would be,
and how many volumes it would require to search this out by
thorough investigation and demonstrate it by argument? And
then, because of that which without dispute pertains to prophecy,
there are so many things concerning Christ and the
kingdom of heaven, which is the city of God, that to explain
these a larger discussion would be necessary than the due proportion
of this work admits of. Therefore I shall, if I can, so
limit myself, that in carrying through this work, I may, with
God's help, neither say what is superfluous nor omit what is
necessary.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>At what time the promise of God was fulfilled concerning the land of Canaan,
which even carnal Israel got in possession.</i></p>

<p>In the preceding book we said, that in the promise of God
to Abraham two things were promised from the beginning,
the one, namely, that his seed should possess the land of
Canaan, which was intimated when it was said, "Go into a
land that I will show thee, and I will make of thee a great
nation;"<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> but the other far more excellent, concerning not
the carnal but the spiritual seed, by which he is the father,
not of the one nation of Israel, but of all nations who follow
the footsteps of his faith, which began to be promised in these
words, "And in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
And thereafter we showed by yet many other proofs that these
two things were promised. Therefore the seed of Abraham,
that is, the people of Israel according to the flesh, already was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
in the land of promise; and there, not only by holding and
possessing the cities of the enemies, but also by having kings,
had already begun to reign, the promises of God concerning
that people being already in great part fulfilled: not only
those that were made to those three fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob, and whatever others were made in their times, but
those also that were made through Moses himself, by whom
the same people was set free from servitude in Egypt, and by
whom all bygone things were revealed in his times, when he
led the people through the wilderness. But neither by the
illustrious leader Jesus the son of Nun, who led that people
into the land of promise, and, after driving out the nations,
divided it among the twelve tribes according to God's command,
and died; nor after him, in the whole time of the
judges, was the promise of God concerning the land of Canaan
fulfilled, that it should extend from some river of Egypt even
to the great river Euphrates; nor yet was it still prophesied as
to come, but its fulfilment was expected. And it was fulfilled
through David, and Solomon his son, whose kingdom was extended
over the whole promised space; for they subdued all
those nations, and made them tributary. And thus, under
those kings, the seed of Abraham was established in the land
of promise according to the flesh, that is, in the land of Canaan,
so that nothing yet remained to the complete fulfilment of
that earthly promise of God, except that, so far as pertains to
temporal prosperity, the Hebrew nation should remain in the
same land by the succession of posterity in an unshaken state
even to the end of this mortal age, if it obeyed the laws of the
Lord its God. But since God knew it would not do this, He
used His temporal punishments also for training His few
faithful ones in it, and for giving needful warning to those
who should afterwards be in all nations, in whom the other
promise, revealed in the New Testament, was about to be
fulfilled through the incarnation of Christ.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap3"></a>3. <i>Of the threefold meaning of the prophecies, which are to be referred now to
the earthly, now to the heavenly Jerusalem, and now again to both.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Wherefore just as that divine oracle to Abraham, Isaac, and
Jacob, and all the other prophetic signs or sayings which are
given in the earlier sacred writings, so also the other prophecies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
from this time of the kings pertain partly to the nation
of Abraham's flesh, and partly to that seed of his in which all
nations are blessed as fellow-heirs of Christ by the New Testament,
to the possessing of eternal life and the kingdom of the
heavens. Therefore they pertain partly to the bond maid who
gendereth to bondage, that is, the earthly Jerusalem, which is
in bondage with her children; but partly to the free city of
God, that is, the true Jerusalem eternal in the heavens, whose
children are all those that live according to God in the earth:
but there are some things among them which are understood
to pertain to both,&mdash;to the bond maid properly, to the free
woman figuratively.<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<p>Therefore prophetic utterances of three kinds are to be
found; forasmuch as there are some relating to the earthly
Jerusalem, some to the heavenly, and some to both. I think
it proper to prove what I say by examples. The prophet
Nathan was sent to convict king David of heinous sin, and
predict to him what future evils should be consequent on it.
Who can question that this and the like pertain to the terrestrial
city, whether publicly, that is, for the safety or help of
the people, or privately, when there are given forth for each
one's private good divine utterances whereby something of
the future may be known for the use of temporal life? But
where we read, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I
will make for the house of Israel, and for the house of Judah,
a new testament: not according to the testament that I settled
for their fathers in the day when I laid hold of their hand to
lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued
not in my testament, and I regarded them not, saith the
Lord. For this is the testament that I will make for the
house of Israel: after those days, saith the Lord, I will give
my laws in their mind, and will write them upon their hearts,
and I will see to them; and I will be to them a God, and
they shall be to me a people;"<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>&mdash;without doubt this is prophesied
to the Jerusalem above, whose reward is God Himself,
and whose chief and entire good it is to have Him, and
to be His. But this pertains to both, that the city of
God is called Jerusalem, and that it is prophesied the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
of God shall be in it; and this prophecy seems to be fulfilled
when king Solomon builds that most noble temple. For
these things both happened in the earthly Jerusalem, as history
shows, and were types of the heavenly Jerusalem. And this
kind of prophecy, as it were compacted and commingled of
both the others in the ancient canonical books, containing
historical narratives, is of very great significance, and has exercised
and exercises greatly the wits of those who search holy
writ. For example, what we read of historically as predicted
and fulfilled in the seed of Abraham according to the flesh,
we must also inquire the allegorical meaning of, as it is to be
fulfilled in the seed of Abraham according to faith. And so
much is this the case, that some have thought there is nothing
in these books either foretold and effected, or effected although
not foretold, that does not insinuate something else which is
to be referred by figurative signification to the city of God on
high, and to her children who are pilgrims in this life. But
if this be so, then the utterances of the prophets, or rather the
whole of those Scriptures that are reckoned under the title
of the Old Testament, will be not of three, but of two different
kinds. For there will be nothing there which pertains to the
terrestrial Jerusalem only, if whatever is there said and fulfilled
of or concerning her signifies something which also
refers by allegorical prefiguration to the celestial Jerusalem;
but there will be only two kinds, one that pertains to the free
Jerusalem, the other to both. But just as, I think, they err
greatly who are of opinion that none of the records of affairs
in that kind of writings mean anything more than that they
so happened, so I think those very daring who contend that
the whole gist of their contents lies in allegorical significations.
Therefore I have said they are threefold, not twofold. Yet, in
holding this opinion, I do not blame those who may be able
to draw out of everything there a spiritual meaning, only
saving, first of all, the historical truth. For the rest, what
believer can doubt that those things are spoken vainly which
are such that, whether said to have been done or to be yet to
come, they do not beseem either human or divine affairs? Who
would not recall these to spiritual understanding if he could,
or confess that they should be recalled by him who is able?</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap4"></a>4. <i>About the prefigured change of the Israelitic kingdom and priesthood, and
about the things Hannah the mother of Samuel prophesied, personating
the Church.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Therefore the advance of the city of God, where it reached
the times of the kings, yielded a figure, when, on the rejection
of Saul, David first obtained the kingdom on such a footing
that thenceforth his descendants should reign in the earthly
Jerusalem in continual succession; for the course of affairs
signified and foretold, what is not to be passed by in silence,
concerning the change of things to come, what belongs to both
Testaments, the Old and the New,&mdash;where the priesthood and
kingdom are changed by one who is a priest, and at the same
time a king, new and everlasting, even Christ Jesus. For both
the substitution in the ministry of God, on Eli's rejection as
priest, of Samuel, who executed at once the office of priest
and judge, and the establishment of David in the kingdom,
when Saul was rejected, typified this of which I speak. And
Hannah herself, the mother of Samuel, who formerly was
barren, and afterwards was gladdened with fertility, does not
seem to prophesy anything else, when she exultingly pours
forth her thanksgiving to the Lord, on yielding up to God the
same boy she had born and weaned with the same piety with
which she had vowed him. For she says, "My heart is made
strong in the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God; my
mouth is enlarged over mine enemies; I am made glad in Thy
salvation. Because there is none holy as the Lord; and none
is righteous as our God: there is none holy save Thee. Do
not glory so proudly, and do not speak lofty things, neither
let vaunting talk come out of your mouth: for a God of
knowledge is the Lord, and a God preparing His curious
designs. The bow of the mighty hath He made weak, and
the weak are girded with strength. They that were full of
bread are diminished; and the hungry have passed beyond the
earth: for the barren hath born seven; and she that hath
many children is waxed feeble. The Lord killeth and maketh
alive: He bringeth down to hell, and bringeth up again. The
Lord maketh poor and maketh rich: He bringeth low and
lifteth up. He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth
up the beggar from the dunghill, that He may set him among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the mighty of [His] people, and maketh them inherit the
throne of glory; giving the vow to him that voweth, and He
hath blessed the years of the just: for man is not mighty in
strength. The Lord shall make His adversary weak: the Lord
is holy. Let not the prudent glory in his prudence; and let
not the mighty glory in his might; and let not the rich glory
in his riches: but let him that glorieth glory in this, to understand
and know the Lord, and to do judgment and justice in
the midst of the earth. The Lord hath ascended into the
heavens, and hath thundered: He shall judge the ends of the
earth, for He is righteous: and He giveth strength to our kings,
and shall exalt the horn of His Christ."<a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a></p>

<p>Do you say that these are the words of a single weak
woman giving thanks for the birth of a son? Can the mind
of men be so much averse to the light of truth as not to perceive
that the sayings this woman pours forth exceed her
measure? Moreover, he who is suitably interested in these
things which have already begun to be fulfilled even in this
earthly pilgrimage also, does he not apply his mind, and perceive,
and acknowledge, that through this woman&mdash;whose
very name, which is Hannah, means "His grace"&mdash;the very
Christian religion, the very city of God, whose king and
founder is Christ, in fine, the very grace of God, hath thus
spoken by the prophetic Spirit, whereby the proud are cut off
so that they fall, and the humble are filled so that they rise,
which that hymn chiefly celebrates? Unless perchance any
one will say that this woman prophesied nothing, but only
lauded God with exulting praise on account of the son whom
she had obtained in answer to prayer. What then does she
mean when she says, "The bow of the mighty hath He made
weak, and the weak are girded with strength; they that were
full of bread are diminished, and the hungry have gone
beyond the earth; for the barren hath born seven, and she
that hath many children is waxed feeble?" Had she herself
born seven, although she had been barren? She had only
one when she said that; neither did she bear seven afterwards,
nor six, with whom Samuel himself might be the
seventh, but three males and two females. And then, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
as yet no one was king over that people, whence, if she did
not prophesy, did she say what she puts at the end, "He
giveth strength to our kings, and shall exalt the horn of His
Christ?"</p>

<p>Therefore let the Church of Christ, the city of the great
King,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> full of grace, prolific of offspring, let her say what the
prophecy uttered about her so long before by the mouth of
this pious mother confesses, "My heart is made strong in
the Lord, and my horn is exalted in my God." Her heart is
truly made strong, and her horn is truly exalted, because not
in herself, but in the Lord her God. "My mouth is enlarged
over mine enemies;" because even in pressing straits the
word of God is not bound, not even in preachers who are
bound.<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> "I am made glad," she says, "in Thy salvation."
This is Christ Jesus Himself, whom old Simeon, as we read
in the Gospel, embracing as a little one, yet recognising as
great, said, "Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in
peace, for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation."<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> Therefore
may the Church say, "I am made glad in Thy salvation. For
there is none holy as the Lord, and none is righteous as our
God;" as holy and sanctifying, just and justifying.<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> "There
is none holy beside Thee;" because no one becomes so except
by reason of Thee. And then it follows, "Do not glory so
proudly, and do not speak lofty things, neither let vaunting
talk come out of your mouth. For a God of knowledge is
the Lord." He knows you even when no one knows; for
"he who thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing
deceiveth himself."<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> These things are said to the adversaries
of the city of God who belong to Babylon, who presume
in their own strength, and glory in themselves, not in the
Lord; of whom are also the carnal Israelites, the earth-born
inhabitants of the earthly Jerusalem, who, as saith the apostle,
"being ignorant of the righteousness of God,"<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> that is, which
God, who alone is just, and the justifier, gives to man, "and
wishing to establish their own," that is, which is as it were
procured by their own selves, not bestowed by Him, "are not
subject to the righteousness of God," just because they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
proud, and think they are able to please God with their own,
not with that which is of God, who is the God of knowledge,
and therefore also takes the oversight of consciences, there
beholding the thoughts of men that they are vain,<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> if they
are of men, and are not from Him. "And preparing," she
says, "His curious designs." What curious designs do we
think these are, save that the proud must fall, and the humble
rise? These curious designs she recounts, saying, "The bow
of the mighty is made weak, and the weak are girded with
strength." The bow is made weak, that is, the intention of
those who think themselves so powerful, that without the gift
and help of God they are able by human sufficiency to fulfil
the divine commandments; and those are girded with strength
whose inward cry is, "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I
am weak."<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a></p>

<p>"They that were full of bread," she says, "are diminished,
and the hungry have gone beyond the earth." Who are to
be understood as full of bread except those same who were
as if mighty, that is, the Israelites, to whom were committed
the oracles of God?<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> But among that people the children
of the bond maid were diminished,&mdash;by which word minus,
although it is Latin, the idea is well expressed that from
being greater they were made less,&mdash;because, even in the
very bread, that is, the divine oracles, which the Israelites
alone of all nations have received, they savour earthly things.
But the nations to whom that law was not given, after they
have come through the New Testament to these oracles, by
thirsting much have gone beyond the earth, because in them
they have savoured not earthly, but heavenly things. And
the reason why this is done is as it were sought; "for the
barren," she says, "hath born seven, and she that hath many
children is waxed feeble." Here all that had been prophesied
hath shone forth to those who understood the number seven,
which signifies the perfection of the universal Church. For
which reason also the Apostle John writes to the seven
churches,<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> showing in that way that he writes to the totality
of the one Church; and in the Proverbs of Solomon it is said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
aforetime, prefiguring this, "Wisdom hath builded her house,
she hath strengthened her seven pillars."<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> For the city of
God was barren in all nations before that child arose whom
we see.<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> We also see that the temporal Jerusalem, who had
many children, is now waxed feeble. Because, whoever in
her were sons of the free woman were her strength; but
now, forasmuch as the letter is there, and not the spirit,
having lost her strength, she is waxed feeble.</p>

<p>"The Lord killeth and maketh alive:" He has killed her
who had many children, and made this barren one alive, so
that she has born seven. Although it may be more suitably
understood that He has made those same alive whom He has
killed. For she, as it were, repeats that by adding, "He
bringeth down to hell, and bringeth up." To whom truly the
apostle says, "If ye be dead with Christ, seek those things
which are above, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of
God."<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Therefore they are killed by the Lord in a salutary
way, so that he adds, "Savour things which are above, not
things on the earth;" so that these are they who, hungering,
have passed beyond the earth. "For ye are dead," he says:
behold how God savingly kills! Then there follows, "And
your life is hid with Christ in God:" behold how God makes
the same alive! But does He bring them down to hell and bring
them up again? It is without controversy among believers
that we best see both parts of this work fulfilled in Him, to
wit, our Head, with whom the apostle has said our life is hid
in God. "For when He spared not His own Son, but delivered
Him up for us all,"<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> in that way, certainly, He has killed
Him. And forasmuch as He raised Him up again from the
dead, He has made Him alive again. And since His voice
is acknowledged in the prophecy, "Thou wilt not leave my
soul in hell,"<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> He has brought Him down to hell and brought
Him up again. By this poverty of His we are made rich;<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a>
for "the Lord maketh poor and maketh rich." But that we
may know what this is, let us hear what follows: "He
bringeth low and lifteth up;" and truly He humbles the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
proud and exalts the humble. Which we also read elsewhere,
"God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the
humble."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> This is the burden of the entire song of this
woman whose name is interpreted "His grace."</p>

<p>Farther, what is added, "He raiseth up the poor from the
earth," I understand of none better than of Him who, as was
said a little ago, "was made poor for us, when He was rich,
that by His poverty we might be made rich." For He raised
Him from the earth so quickly that His flesh did not see
corruption. Nor shall I divert from Him what is added, "And
raiseth up the poor from the dunghill." For indeed he who
is the poor man is also the beggar.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> But by the dunghill
from which he is lifted up we are with the greatest reason
to understand the persecuting Jews, of whom the apostle says,
when telling that when he belonged to them he persecuted
the Church, "What things were gain to me, those I counted
loss for Christ; and I have counted them not only loss, but
even dung, that I might win Christ."<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> Therefore that poor
one is raised up from the earth above all the rich, and that
beggar is lifted up from that dunghill above all the wealthy,
"that he may sit among the mighty of the people," to whom
He says, "Ye shall sit upon twelve thrones,"<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> "and to make
them inherit the throne of glory." For these mighty ones
had said, "Lo, we have forsaken all and followed Thee."
They had most mightily vowed this vow.</p>

<p>But whence do they receive this, except from Him of whom
it is here immediately said, "Giving the vow to him that
voweth?" Otherwise they would be of those mighty ones
whose bow is weakened. "Giving," she saith, "the vow to
him that voweth." For no one could vow anything acceptable
to God, unless he received from Him that which he
might vow. There follows, "And He hath blessed the years
of the just," to wit, that he may live for ever with Him to
whom it is said, "And Thy years shall have no end." For
there the years abide; but here they pass away, yea, they
perish: for before they come they are not, and when they
shall have come they shall not be, because they bring their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
own end with them. Now of these two, that is, "giving
the vow to him that voweth," and "He hath blessed the years
of the just," the one is what we do, the other what we receive.
But this other is not received from God, the liberal
giver, until He, the helper, Himself has enabled us for the
former; "for man is not mighty in strength." "The Lord
shall make his adversary weak," to wit, him who envies the
man that vows, and resists him, lest he should fulfil what he
has vowed. Owing to the ambiguity of the Greek, it may
also be understood "his own adversary." For when God
has begun to possess us, immediately he who had been our
adversary becomes His, and is conquered by us; but not by
our own strength, "for man is not mighty in strength."
Therefore "the Lord shall make His own adversary weak,
the Lord is holy," that he may be conquered by the saints,
whom the Lord, the Holy of holies, hath made saints. For
this reason, "let not the prudent glory in his prudence, and
let not the mighty glory in his might, and let not the rich
glory in his riches; but let him that glorieth glory in
this,&mdash;to understand and know the Lord, and to do judgment
and justice in the midst of the earth." He in no
small measure understands and knows the Lord who understands
and knows that even this, that he can understand and
know the Lord, is given to him by the Lord. "For what
hast thou," saith the apostle, "that thou hast not received?
But if thou hast received it, why dost thou glory as if
thou hadst not received it?"<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> That is, as if thou hadst of
thine own self whereof thou mightest glory. Now, he does
judgment and justice who lives aright. But he lives aright
who yields obedience to God when He commands. "The end
of the commandment," that is, to which the commandment
has reference, "is charity out of a pure heart, and a good
conscience, and faith unfeigned." Moreover, this "charity,"
as the Apostle John testifies, "is of God."<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Therefore to do
justice and judgment is of God. But what is "in the midst
of the earth?" For ought those who dwell in the ends of
the earth not to do judgment and justice? Who would say
so? Why, then, is it added, "In the midst of the earth?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
For if this had not been added, and it had only been said, "To
do judgment and justice," this commandment would rather
have pertained to both kinds of men,&mdash;both those dwelling
inland and those on the sea-coast. But lest any one should
think that, after the end of the life led in this body, there
remains a time for doing judgment and justice which he has
not done while he was in the flesh, and that the divine judgment
can thus be escaped, "in the midst of the earth" appears
to me to be said of the time when every one lives in
the body; for in this life every one carries about his own
earth, which, on a man's dying, the common earth takes back,
to be surely returned to him on his rising again. Therefore
"in the midst of the earth," that is, while our soul is shut
up in this earthly body, judgment and justice are to be done,
which shall be profitable for us hereafter, when "every one
shall receive according to that he hath done in the body,
whether good or bad."<a name="FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> For when the apostle there says "in
the body," he means in the time he has lived in the body.
Yet if any one blaspheme with malicious mind and impious
thought, without any member of his body being employed in
it, he shall not therefore be guiltless because he has not done
it with bodily motion, for he will have done it in that time
which he has spent in the body. In the same way we may
suitably understand what we read in the psalm, "But God, our
King before the worlds, hath wrought salvation in the midst
of the earth;"<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> so that the Lord Jesus may be understood to be
our God who is before the worlds, because by Him the worlds
were made, working our salvation in the midst of the earth,
for the Word was made flesh and dwelt in an earthly body.</p>

<p>Then after Hannah has prophesied in these words, that
he who glorieth ought to glory not in himself at all, but in
the Lord, she says, on account of the retribution which is to
come on the day of judgment, "The Lord hath ascended into
the heavens, and hath thundered: He shall judge the ends of
the earth, for He is righteous." Throughout she holds to the
order of the creed of Christians: For the Lord Christ has
ascended into heaven, and is to come thence to judge the quick
and dead.<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> For, as saith the apostle, "Who hath ascended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
but He who hath also descended into the lower parts of the
earth? He that descended is the same also that ascended
up above all heavens, that He might fill all things."<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> Therefore
He hath thundered through His clouds, which He hath
filled with His Holy Spirit when He ascended up. Concerning
which the bond maid Jerusalem that is, the unfruitful
vineyard is threatened in Isaiah the prophet that they
shall rain no showers upon her. But "He shall judge the
ends of the earth" is spoken as if it had been said, "even
the extremes of the earth." For it does not mean that He
shall not judge the other parts of the earth, who, without
doubt, shall judge all men. But it is better to understand
by the extremes of the earth the extremes of man, since
those things shall not be judged which, in the middle time,
are changed for the better or the worse, but the ending in
which he shall be found who is judged. For which reason
it is said, "He that shall persevere even unto the end, the
same shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> He, therefore, who perseveringly does
judgment and justice in the midst of the earth shall not be
condemned when the extremes of the earth shall be judged.
"And giveth," she saith, "strength to our kings," that He may
not condemn them in judging. He giveth them strength
whereby as kings they rule the flesh, and conquer the world
in Him who hath poured out His blood for them. "And
shall exalt the horn of His Christ." For He of whom it was said above,
"The Lord hath ascended into the heavens," meaning the Lord
Christ, Himself, as it is said here, "shall exalt the horn of His
Christ." Who, therefore, is the Christ of His Christ? Does
it mean that He shall exalt the horn of each one of His believing
people, as she says in the beginning of this hymn,
"Mine horn is exalted in my God?" For we can rightly
call all those christs who are anointed with His chrism, forasmuch
as the whole body with its head is one Christ.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> These
things hath Hannah, the mother of Samuel, the holy and
much-praised man, prophesied, in which, indeed, the change
of the ancient priesthood was then figured and is now fulfilled,
since she that had many children is waxed feeble, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the barren who hath born seven might have the new priesthood
in Christ.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>5. <i>Of those things which a man of God spake by the Spirit to Eli the priest,
signifying that the priesthood which had been appointed according to
Aaron was to be taken away.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But this is said more plainly by a man of God sent to Eli
the priest himself, whose name indeed is not mentioned, but
whose office and ministry show him to have been indubitably
a prophet. For it is thus written: "And there came a man
of God unto Eli, and said, Thus saith the Lord, I plainly
revealed myself unto thy father's house, when they were in
the land of Egypt slaves in Pharaoh's house; and I chose thy
father's house out of all the sceptres of Israel to fill the office
of priest for me, to go up to my altar, to burn incense and
wear the ephod; and I gave thy father's house for food all
the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel. Wherefore
then hast thou looked at mine incense and at mine offerings
with an impudent eye, and hast glorified thy sons above
me, to bless the first-fruits of every sacrifice in Israel before
me? Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I said thy
house and thy father's house should walk before me for ever:
but now the Lord saith, Be it far from me; for them that
honour me will I honour, and he that despiseth me shall be
despised. Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thy seed,
and the seed of thy father's house, and thou shalt never have
an old man in my house. And I will cut off the man of thine
from mine altar, so that his eyes shall be consumed, and his
heart shall melt away; and every one of thy house that is
left shall fall by the sword of men. And this shall be a sign
unto thee that shall come upon these thy two sons, Hophni
and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of them. And
I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do according to
all that is in mine heart and in my soul; and I will build
him a sure house, and he shall walk before my Christ for
ever. And it shall come to pass that he who is left in thine
house shall come to worship him with a piece of money, saying,
Put me into one part of thy priesthood, that I may eat bread."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a></p>

<p>We cannot say that this prophecy, in which the change of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
the ancient priesthood is foretold with so great plainness, was
fulfilled in Samuel; for although Samuel was not of another
tribe than that which had been appointed by God to serve at
the altar, yet he was not of the sons of Aaron, whose offspring
was set apart that the priests might be taken out of it. And
thus by that transaction also the same change which should
come to pass through Christ Jesus is shadowed forth, and the
prophecy itself in deed, not in word, belonged to the Old
Testament properly, but figuratively to the New, signifying
by the fact just what was said by the word to Eli the priest
through the prophet. For there were afterwards priests of
Aaron's race, such as Zadok and Abiathar during David's
reign, and others in succession, before the time came when
those things which were predicted so long before about the
changing of the priesthood behoved to be fulfilled by Christ.
But who that now views these things with a believing eye
does not see that they are fulfilled? Since, indeed, no tabernacle,
no temple, no altar, no sacrifice, and therefore no priest
either, has remained to the Jews, to whom it was commanded
in the law of God that he should be ordained of the seed of
Aaron; which is also mentioned here by the prophet, when
he says, "Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, I said thy house
and thy father's house shall walk before me for ever: but
now the Lord saith, That be far from me; for them that honour
me will I honour, and he that despiseth me shall be despised."
For that in naming his father's house he does not mean that
of his immediate father, but that of Aaron, who first was
appointed priest, to be succeeded by others descended from
him, is shown by the preceding words, when he says, "I was
revealed unto thy father's house, when they were in the land
of Egypt slaves in Pharaoh's house; and I chose thy father's
house out of all the sceptres of Israel to fill the office of priest
for me." Which of the fathers in that Egyptian slavery, but
Aaron, was his father, who, when they were set free, was
chosen to the priesthood? It was of his lineage, therefore, he
has said in this passage it should come to pass that they should
no longer be priests; which already we see fulfilled. If faith
be watchful, the things are before us: they are discerned, they
are grasped, and are forced on the eyes of the unwilling, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
that they are seen: "Behold the days come," he says, "that
I will cut off thy seed, and the seed of thy father's house, and
thou shalt never have an old man in mine house. And I will
cut off the man of thine from mine altar, so that his eyes shall
be consumed and his heart shall melt away." Behold the
days which were foretold have already come. There is no
priest after the order of Aaron; and whoever is a man of his
lineage, when he sees the sacrifice of the Christians prevailing
over the whole world, but that great honour taken away from
himself, his eyes fail and his soul melts away consumed with
grief.</p>

<p>But what follows belongs properly to the house of Eli, to
whom these things were said: "And every one of thine house
that is left shall fall by the sword of men. And this shall
be a sign unto thee that shall come upon these thy two sons,
Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die both of
them." This, therefore, is made a sign of the change of the
priesthood from this man's house, by which it is signified that
the priesthood of Aaron's house is to be changed. For the
death of this man's sons signified the death not of the men,
but of the priesthood itself of the sons of Aaron. But what
follows pertains to that Priest whom Samuel typified by succeeding
this one. Therefore the things which follow are said
of Christ Jesus the true Priest of the New Testament: "And
I will raise me up a faithful Priest that shall do according to
all that is in mine heart and in my soul; and I will build
Him a sure house." The same is the eternal Jerusalem above.
"And He shall walk," saith He, "before my Christ always."
"He shall walk" means "he shall be conversant with," just as
He had said before of Aaron's house, "I said that thine house
and thy father's house shall walk before me for ever." But
what He says, "He shall walk before my Christ," is to be
understood entirely of the house itself, not of the priest, who
is Christ Himself, the Mediator and Saviour. His house,
therefore, shall walk before Him. "Shall walk" may also be
understood to mean from death to life, all the time this mortality
passes through, even to the end of this world. But
where God says, "Who will do all that is in mine heart and
in my soul," we must not think that God has a soul, for He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
is the Author of souls; but this is said of God tropically, not
properly, just as He is said to have hands and feet, and other
corporal members. And, lest it should be supposed from
such language that man in the form of this flesh is made in
the image of God, wings also are ascribed to Him, which man
has not at all; and it is said to God, "Hide me under the
shadow of Thy wings,"<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a> that men may understand that such
things are said of that ineffable nature not in proper but in
figurative words.</p>

<p>But what is added, "And it shall come to pass that he who
is left in thine house shall come to worship Him," is not said
properly of the house of this Eli, but of that Aaron, the men
of which remained even to the advent of Jesus Christ, of
which race there are not wanting men even to this present.
For of that house of Eli it had already been said above, "And
every one of thine house that is left shall fall by the sword of
men." How, therefore, could it be truly said here, "And it
shall come to pass that every one that is left shall come to
worship him," if that is true, that no one shall escape the
avenging sword, unless he would have it understood of those
who belong to the race of that whole priesthood after the order
of Aaron? Therefore, if it is of these the predestinated
remnant, about whom another prophet has said, "The remnant
shall be saved;"<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> whence the apostle also says, "Even so then
at this time also the remnant according to the election of
grace is saved;"<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> since it is easily understood to be of such
a remnant that it is said, "He that is left in thine house,"
assuredly he believes in Christ; just as in the time of the
apostle very many of that nation believed; nor are there now
wanting those, although very few, who yet believe, and in
them is fulfilled what this man of God has here immediately
added, "He shall come to worship him with a piece of money;"
to worship whom, if not that Chief Priest, who is also God?
For in that priesthood after the order of Aaron men did not
come to the temple or altar of God for the purpose of worshipping
the priest. But what is that he says, "With a piece
of money," if not the short word of faith, about which the
apostle quotes the saying, "A consummating and shortening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
word will the Lord make upon the earth?"<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> But that
money is put for the word the psalm is a witness, where it
is sung, "The words of the Lord are pure words, money tried
with the fire."<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>What then does he say who comes to worship the priest of
God, even the Priest who is God? "Put me into one part of
Thy priesthood, to eat bread." I do not wish to be set in the
honour of my fathers, which is none; put me in a part of Thy
priesthood. For "I have chosen to be mean in Thine house;"<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a>
I desire to be a member, no matter what, or how small, of Thy
priesthood. By the priesthood he here means the people itself,
of which He is the Priest who is the Mediator between God
and men, the man Christ Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a> This people the Apostle Peter
calls "a holy people, a royal priesthood."<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> But some have
translated, "Of Thy sacrifice," not "Of Thy priesthood," which
no less signifies the same Christian people. Whence the
Apostle Paul says, "We being many are one bread, one body."<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a>
[And again he says, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice."<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a>]
What, therefore, he has added, to "eat bread," also elegantly
expresses the very kind of sacrifice of which the Priest Himself
says, "The bread which I will give is my flesh for the life
of the world."<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> The same is the sacrifice not after the order
of Aaron, but after the order of Melchisedec:<a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> let him that
readeth understand.<a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> Therefore this short and salutarily
humble confession, in which it is said, "Put me in a part of
Thy priesthood, to eat bread," is itself the piece of money, for
it is both brief, and it is the Word of God who dwells in the
heart of one who believes. For because He had said above,
that He had given for food to Aaron's house the sacrificial
victims of the Old Testament, where He says, "I have given
thy father's house for food all things which are offered by fire
of the children of Israel," which indeed were the sacrifices of
the Jews; therefore here He has said, "To eat bread," which
is in the New Testament the sacrifice of the Christians.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>6. <i>Of the Jewish priesthood and kingdom, which, although promised to be established
for ever, did not continue; so that other things are to be understood
to which eternity is assured.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>While, therefore, these things now shine forth as clearly
as they were loftily foretold, still some one may not vainly
be moved to ask, How can we be confident that all things
are to come to pass which are predicted in these books as
about to come, if this very thing which is there divinely
spoken, "Thine house and thy father's house shall walk
before me for ever," could not have effect? For we see that
priesthood has been changed; and there can be no hope that
what was promised to that house may some time be fulfilled,
because that which succeeds on its being rejected and changed
is rather predicted as eternal. He who says this does not
yet understand, or does not recollect, that this very priesthood
after the order of Aaron was appointed as the shadow
of a future eternal priesthood; and therefore, when eternity
is promised to it, it is not promised to the mere shadow and
figure, but to what is shadowed forth and prefigured by it.
But lest it should be thought the shadow itself was to remain,
therefore its mutation also behoved to be foretold.</p>

<p>In this way, too, the kingdom of Saul himself, who certainly
was reprobated and rejected, was the shadow of a
kingdom yet to come which should remain to eternity. For,
indeed, the oil with which he was anointed, and from that
chrism he is called Christ, is to be taken in a mystical sense,
and is to be understood as a great mystery; which David
himself venerated so much in him, that he trembled with
smitten heart when, being hid in a dark cave, which Saul
also entered when pressed by the necessity of nature, he had
come secretly behind him and cut off a small piece of his
robe, that he might be able to prove how he had spared him
when he could have killed him, and might thus remove from
his mind the suspicion through which he had vehemently
persecuted the holy David, thinking him his enemy. Therefore
he was much afraid lest he should be accused of violating
so great a mystery in Saul, because he had thus meddled
even his clothes. For thus it is written: "And David's
heart smote him because he had taken away the skirt of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
cloak."<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> But to the men with him, who advised him to destroy
Saul thus delivered up into his hands, he saith, "The Lord forbid
that I should do this thing to my lord, the Lord's christ, to lay
my hand upon him, because he is the Lord's christ." Therefore
he showed so great reverence to this shadow of what was
to come, not for its own sake, but for the sake of what it
prefigured. Whence also that which Samuel says to Saul,
"Since thou hast not kept my commandment which the Lord
commanded thee, whereas now the Lord would have prepared
thy kingdom over Israel for ever, yet now thy kingdom shall
not continue for thee; and the Lord will seek Him a man after
His own heart, and the Lord will command him to be prince
over His people, because thou hast not kept that which the Lord
commanded thee,"<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> is not to be taken as if God had settled
that Saul himself should reign for ever, and afterwards, on his
sinning, would not keep this promise; nor was He ignorant
that he would sin, but He had established his kingdom that
it might be a figure of the eternal kingdom. Therefore he
added, "Yet now thy kingdom shall not continue <i>for thee</i>."
Therefore what it signified has stood and shall stand; but it
shall not stand for this man, because he himself was not to
reign for ever, nor his offspring; so that at least that word
"for ever" might seem to be fulfilled through his posterity
one to another. "And the Lord," he saith, "will seek Him
a man," meaning either David or the Mediator of the New
Testament,<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> who was figured in the chrism with which David
also and his offspring was anointed. But it is not as if He
knew not where he was that God thus seeks Him a man,
but, speaking through a man, He speaks as a man, and in this
sense seeks us. For not only to God the Father, but also to
His Only-begotten, who came to seek what was lost,<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> we had
been known already even so far as to be chosen in Him
before the foundation of the world.<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> "He will seek him"
therefore means, He will have His own (just as if He had
said, Whom He already has known to be His own He will
show to others to be His friend). Whence in Latin this word
(<i>qu√¶rit</i>) receives a preposition and becomes <i>acquirit</i> (acquires),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the meaning of which is plain enough; although even without
the addition of the preposition <i>qu√¶rere</i> is understood as
<i>acquirere</i>, whence gains are called <i>qu√¶stus</i>.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Of the disruption of the kingdom of Israel, by which the perpetual division of
the spiritual from the carnal Israel was prefigured.</i></p>

<p>Again Saul sinned through disobedience, and again Samuel
says to him in the word of the Lord, "Because thou hast despised
the word of the Lord, the Lord hath despised thee, that
thou mayest not be king over Israel."<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> And again for the same
sin, when Saul confessed it, and prayed for pardon, and besought
Samuel to return with him to appease the Lord, he said, "I
will not return with thee: for thou hast despised the word of
the Lord, and the Lord will despise thee that thou mayest not
be king over Israel. And Samuel turned his face to go away,
and Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and rent it.
And Samuel said unto him, The Lord hath rent the kingdom
from Israel out of thine hand this day, and will give it to thy
neighbour, who is good above thee, and will divide Israel in
twain. And He will not be changed, neither will He repent:
for He is not as a man, that He should repent; who threatens
and does not persist."<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> He to whom it is said, "The Lord
will despise thee that thou mayest not be king over Israel,"
and "The Lord hath rent the kingdom from Israel out of
thine hand this day," reigned forty years over Israel,&mdash;that is,
just as long a time as David himself,&mdash;yet heard this in the
first period of his reign, that we may understand it was said
because none of his race was to reign, and that we may look
to the race of David, whence also is sprung, according to the
flesh,<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ
Jesus.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p>

<p>But the Scripture has not what is read in most Latin
copies, "The Lord hath rent the kingdom of Israel out of
thine hand this day," but just as we have set it down it is
found in the Greek copies, "The Lord hath rent the kingdom
from Israel out of thine hand;" that the words "out of thine
hand" may be understood to mean "from Israel." Therefore
this man figuratively represented the people of Israel, which
was to lose the kingdom, Christ Jesus our Lord being about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
to reign, not carnally, but spiritually. And when it is said
of Him, "And will give it to thy neighbour," that is to be referred
to the fleshly kinship, for Christ, according to the flesh,
was of Israel, whence also Saul sprang. But what is added,
"Good above thee," may indeed be understood, "Better than
thee," and indeed some have thus translated it; but it is
better taken thus, "Good above thee," as meaning that because
He is good, therefore He must be above thee, according
to that other prophetic saying, "Till I put all Thine enemies
under Thy feet."<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> And among them is Israel, from whom, as
His persecutor, Christ took away the kingdom; although the
Israel in whom there was no guile may have been there too,
a sort of grain, as it were, of that chaff. For certainly thence
came the apostles, thence so many martyrs, of whom Stephen,
is the first, thence so many churches, which the Apostle Paul
names, magnifying God in their conversion.</p>

<p>Of which thing I do not doubt what follows is to be understood,
"And will divide Israel in twain," to wit, into Israel
pertaining to the bond woman, and Israel pertaining to the
free. For these two kinds were at first together, as Abraham
still clave to the bond woman, until the barren, made,
fruitful by the grace of God, cried, "Cast out the bond
woman and her son."<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> We know, indeed, that on account
of the sin of Solomon, in the reign of his son Rehoboam
Israel was divided in two, and continued so, the separate parts
having their own kings, until that whole nation was overthrown
with a great destruction, and carried away by the Chaldeans.
But what was this to Saul, when, if any such thing was
threatened, it would be threatened against David himself,
whose son Solomon was? Finally, the Hebrew nation is not
now divided internally, but is dispersed through the earth indiscriminately,
in the fellowship of the same error. But that
division with which God threatened the kingdom and people
in the person of Saul, who represented them, is shown to be
eternal and unchangeable by this which is added, "And He
will not be changed, neither will He repent: for He is not as
a man, that He should repent; who threatens and does not persist,"&mdash;that
is, a man threatens and does not persist, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
God, who does not repent like man. For when we read that
He repents, a change of circumstance is meant, flowing from the
divine immutable foreknowledge. Therefore, when God is said
not to repent, it is to be understood that He does not change.</p>

<p>We see that this sentence concerning this division of the
people of Israel, divinely uttered in these words, has been
altogether irremediable and quite perpetual. For whoever
have turned, or are turning, or shall turn thence to Christ, it
has been according to the foreknowledge of God, not according
to the one and the same nature of the human race. Certainly
none of the Israelites, who, cleaving to Christ, have
continued in Him, shall ever be among those Israelites who
persist in being His enemies even to the end of this life,
but shall for ever remain in the separation which is here
foretold. For the Old Testament, from the Mount Sinai,
which gendereth to bondage,<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a> profiteth nothing, unless because
it bears witness to the New Testament. Otherwise, however
long Moses is read, the veil is put over their heart; but
when any one shall turn thence to Christ, the veil shall be
taken away.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> For the very desire of those who turn is
changed from the old to the new, so that each no longer
desires to obtain carnal but spiritual felicity. Wherefore
that great prophet Samuel himself, before he had anointed
Saul, when he had cried to the Lord for Israel, and He had
heard him, and when he had offered a whole burnt-offering,
as the aliens were coming to battle against the people of God,
and the Lord thundered above them and they were confused,
and fell before Israel and were overcome; [then] he took one
stone and set it up between the old and new Massephat
(Mizpeh), and called its name Ebenezer, which means "the
stone of the helper," and said, "Hitherto hath the Lord helped
us."<a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> Massephat is interpreted "desire." That stone of the
helper is the mediation of the Saviour, by which we go from
the old Massephat to the new,&mdash;that is, from the desire with
which carnal happiness was expected in the carnal kingdom
to the desire with which the truest spiritual happiness is expected
in the kingdom of heaven; and since nothing is better
than that, the Lord helpeth us hitherto.</p>

<p class="center"><a id="chap8"></a>8. <i>Of the promises made to David in his son, which are in no wise fulfilled in
Solomon, but most fully in Christ.</i></p>

<p>And now I see I must show what, pertaining to the matter
I treat of, God promised to David himself, who succeeded Saul
in the kingdom, whose change prefigured that final change on
account of which all things were divinely spoken, all things
were committed to writing. When many things had gone prosperously
with king David, he thought to make a house for
God, even that temple of most excellent renown which was
afterwards built by king Solomon his son. While he was
thinking of this, the word of the Lord came to Nathan the
prophet, which he brought to the king, in which, after God
had said that a house should not be built unto Him by David
himself, and that in all that long time He had never commanded
any of His people to build Him a house of cedar, he
says, "And now thus shalt thou say unto my servant David,
Thus saith God Almighty, I took thee from the sheep-cote
that thou mightest be for a ruler over my people in Israel:
and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have
cut off all thine enemies from before thy face, and have made
thee a name, according to the name of the great ones who are
over the earth. And I will appoint a place for my people
Israel, and will plant him, and he shall dwell apart, and shall
be troubled no more; and the son of wickedness shall not
humble him any more, as from the beginning, from the days
when I appointed judges over my people Israel. And I will
give thee rest from all thine enemies, and the Lord will tell
[hath told] thee, because thou shalt build an house for Him.
And it shall come to pass when thy days be fulfilled, and
thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy
seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I
will prepare his kingdom. He shall build me an house for
my name; and I will order his throne even to eternity. I
will be his Father, and he shall be my son. And if he commit
iniquity, I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with
the stripes of the sons of men: but my mercy I will not take
away from him, as I took it away from those whom I put
away from before my face. And his house shall be faithful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
and his kingdom even for evermore before me, and his throne
shall be set up even for evermore."<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>He who thinks this grand promise was fulfilled in Solomon
greatly errs; for he attends to the saying, "He shall build
me an house," but he does not attend to the saying, "His
house shall be faithful, and his kingdom for evermore before
me." Let him therefore attend and behold the house of
Solomon full of strange women worshipping false gods, and
the king himself, aforetime wise, seduced by them, and cast
down into the same idolatry: and let him not dare to think
that God either promised this falsely, or was unable to foreknow
that Solomon and his house would become what they
did. But we ought not to be in doubt here, or to see the
fulfilment of these things save in Christ our Lord, who was
made of the seed of David according to the flesh,<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> lest we
should vainly and uselessly look for some other here, like the
carnal Jews. For even they understand this much, that the
son whom they read of in that place as promised to David
was not Solomon; so that, with wonderful blindness to Him
who was promised and is now declared with so great manifestation,
they say they hope for another. Indeed, even in Solomon
there appeared some image of the future event, in that
he built the temple, and had peace according to his name (for
Solomon means "pacific"), and in the beginning of his reign
was wonderfully praiseworthy; but while, as a shadow of Him
that should come, he foreshowed Christ our Lord, he did not
also in his own person resemble Him. Whence some things
concerning him are so written as if they were prophesied
of himself, while the Holy Scripture, prophesying even by
events, somehow delineates in him the figure of things to
come. For, besides the books of divine history, in which his
reign is narrated, the 72d Psalm also is inscribed in the title
with his name, in which so many things are said which cannot
at all apply to him, but which apply to the Lord Christ
with such evident fitness as makes it quite apparent that in
the one the figure is in some way shadowed forth, but in the
other the truth itself is presented. For it is known within
what bounds the kingdom of Solomon was enclosed; and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
in that psalm, not to speak of other things, we read, "He
shall have dominion from sea even to sea, and from the river
to the ends of the earth,"<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> which we see fulfilled in Christ.
Truly he took the beginning of His reigning from the river
where John baptized; for, when pointed out by him, He began
to be acknowledged by the disciples, who called Him not only
Master, but also Lord.</p>

<p>Nor was it for any other reason that, while his father David
was still living, Solomon began to reign, which happened to
none other of their kings, except that from this also it might
be clearly apparent that it was not himself this prophecy
spoken to his father signified beforehand, saying, "And it
shall come to pass when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt
sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed which
shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will prepare His kingdom."
How, therefore, shall it be thought on account of what
follows, "He shall build me an house," that this Solomon is
prophesied, and not rather be understood on account of what
precedes, "When thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep
with thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee," that
another pacific One is promised, who is foretold as about to
be raised up, not before David's death, as he was, but after
it? For however long the interval of time might be before
Jesus Christ came, beyond doubt it was after the death of
king David, to whom He was so promised, that He behoved
to come, who should build an house of God, not of wood and
stone, but of men, such as we rejoice He does build. For to
this house, that is, to believers, the apostle saith, "The temple
of God is holy, which temple ye are."<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>


<p class="center">9. <i>How like the prophecy about Christ in the</i> 89<i>th Psalm is to the things
promised in Nathan's prophecy in the Books of Samuel.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore also in the 89th Psalm, of which the title is,
"An instruction for himself by Ethan the Israelite," mention
is made of the promises God made to king David, and some
things are there added similar to those found in the Book of
Samuel, such as this, "I have sworn to David my servant
that I will prepare his seed for ever."<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> And again, "Then

help upon the mighty One, and have exalted the chosen One
out of my people. I have found David my servant, and with
my holy oil I have anointed him. For mine hand shall help
him, and mine arm shall strengthen him. The enemy shall
not prevail against him, and the son of iniquity shall harm
him no more. And I will beat down his foes from before
his face, and those that hate him will I put to flight. And
my truth and my mercy shall be with him, and in my name
shall his horn be exalted. I will set his hand also in the
sea, and his right hand in the rivers. He shall cry unto me,
Thou art my Father, my God, and the undertaker of my salvation.
Also I will make him my first-born, high among the
kings of the earth. My mercy will I keep for him for evermore,
and my covenant shall be faithful (sure) with him.
His seed also will I set for ever and ever, and his throne as
the days of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> Which words, when rightly understood,
are all understood to be about the Lord Jesus Christ, under
the name of David, on account of the form of a servant, which
the same Mediator assumed<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> from the virgin of the seed of
David.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> For immediately something is said about the sins of
his children, such as is set down in the Book of Samuel, and
is more readily taken as if of Solomon. For there, that is,
in the Book of Samuel, he says, "And if he commit iniquity,
I will chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes
of the sons of men; but my mercy will I not take away from
him,"<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> meaning by stripes the strokes of correction. Hence
that saying, "Touch ye not my christs."<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> For what else is
that than, Do not harm them? But in the psalm, when
speaking as if of David, He says something of the same kind
there too. "If his children," saith He, "forsake my law, and
walk not in my judgments; if they profane my righteousnesses,
and keep not my commandments; I will visit their
iniquities with the rod, and their faults with stripes: but my
mercy I will not make void from him."<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> He did not say
"from them," although He spoke of his children, not of himself;
but he said "from him," which means the same thing
if rightly understood. For of Christ Himself, who is the head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
of the Church, there could not be found any sins which required
to be divinely restrained by human correction, mercy
being still continued; but they are found in His body and
members, which is His people. Therefore in the Book of
Samuel it is said, "iniquity of Him," but in the psalm, "of
His children," that we may understand that what is said of
His body is in some way said of Himself. Wherefore also,
when Saul persecuted His body, that is, His believing people,
He Himself saith from heaven, "Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me?"<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> Then in the following words of the psalm He
says, "Neither will I hurt in my truth, nor profane my covenant,
and the things that proceed from my lips I will not
disallow. Once have I sworn by my holiness, if I lie unto
David,"<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a>&mdash;that is, I will in no wise lie unto David; for
Scripture is wont to speak thus. But what that is in which
He will not lie, He adds, saying, "His seed shall endure for
ever, and his throne as the sun before me, and as the moon
perfected for ever, and a faithful witness in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

those which God had promised, so that the truth of the promise should be

<p>That it might not be supposed that a promise so strongly
expressed and confirmed was fulfilled in Solomon, as if he
hoped for, yet did not find it, he says, "But Thou hast cast off,
and hast brought to nothing, O Lord."<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> This truly was done
concerning the kingdom of Solomon among his posterity, even
to the overthrow of the earthly Jerusalem itself, which was
the seat of the kingdom, and especially the destruction of the
very temple which had been built by Solomon. But lest on
this account God should be thought to have done contrary to
His promise, immediately he adds, "Thou hast delayed Thy
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Therefore he is not Solomon, nor yet David himself,
if the Christ of the Lord is delayed. For while all the
kings are called His christs, who were consecrated with that
mystical chrism, not only from king David downwards, but
even from that Saul who first was anointed king of that same
people, David himself indeed calling him the Lord's christ,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
yet there was one true Christ, whose figure they bore by the
prophetic unction, who, according to the opinion of men, who
thought he was to be understood as come in David or in
Solomon, was long delayed, but who, according as God had
disposed, was to come in His own time. The following part
of this psalm goes on to say what in the meantime, while He
was delayed, was to become of the kingdom of the earthly
Jerusalem, where it was hoped He would certainly reign:
"Thou hast overthrown the covenant of Thy servant; Thou
hast profaned in the earth his sanctuary. Thou hast broken
down all his walls; Thou hast put his strongholds in fear.
All that pass by the way spoil him; he is made a reproach
to his neighbours. Thou hast set up the right hand of his
enemies; Thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice. Thou
hast turned aside the help of his sword, and hast not helped
him in war. Thou hast destroyed him from cleansing; Thou
hast dashed down his seat to the ground. Thou hast shortened
the days of his seat; Thou hast poured confusion over
him."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> All these things came upon Jerusalem the bond
woman, in which some also reigned who were children of the
free woman, holding that kingdom in temporary stewardship,
but holding the kingdom of the heavenly Jerusalem, whose
children they were, in true faith, and hoping in the true
Christ. But how these things came upon that kingdom, the
history of its affairs points out if it is read.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of the substance of the people of God, which through His assumption of
flesh is in Christ, who alone had power to deliver His own soul from hell.</i></p>

<p>But after having prophesied these things, the prophet betakes
him to praying to God; yet even the very prayer is
prophecy: "How long, Lord, dost Thou turn away in the
end?"<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> "Thy face" is understood, as it is elsewhere said,

therefore some copies have here not "dost," but "wilt Thou
turn away;" although it could be understood, "Thou turnest
away Thy mercy, which Thou didst promise to David." But
when he says, "in the end," what does it mean, except even
to the end? By which end is to be understood the last time,
when even that nation is to believe in Christ Jesus, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
which end what He has just sorrowfully bewailed must come
to pass. On account of which it is also added here, "Thy
wrath shall burn like fire. Remember what is my substance."<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a>
This cannot be better understood than of Jesus
Himself, the substance of His people, of whose nature His
flesh is. "For not in vain," he says, "hast Thou made all the
sons of men."<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a> For unless the one Son of man had been the
substance of Israel, through which Son of man many sons of
men should be set free, all the sons of men would have been
made wholly in vain. But now indeed all mankind through
the fall of the first man has fallen from the truth into vanity;
for which reason another psalm says, "Man is like to vanity:
his days pass away as a shadow;"<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> yet God has not made all
the sons of men in vain, because He frees many from vanity
through the Mediator Jesus, and those whom He did not foreknow
as to be delivered, He made not wholly in vain in the
most beautiful and most just ordination of the whole rational
creation, for the use of those who were to be delivered, and
for the comparison of the two cities by mutual contrast.
Thereafter it follows, "Who is the man that shall live, and
shall not see death? shall he snatch his soul from the hand
of hell?"<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> Who is this but that substance of Israel out of
the seed of David, Christ Jesus, of whom the apostle says,
that "rising from the dead He now dieth not, and death shall
no more have dominion over Him?"<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> For He shall so live and
not see death, that yet He shall have been dead; but shall
have delivered His soul from the hand of hell, whither He had
descended in order to loose some from the chains of hell; but
He hath delivered it by that power of which He says in the
Gospel, "I have the power of laying down my life, and I have
the power of taking it again."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>12. <i>To whose person the entreaty for the promises is to be understood to belong,
when he says in the psalm, "Where are Thine ancient compassions,
Lord?" etc.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But the rest of this psalm runs thus: "Where are Thine
ancient compassions, Lord, which Thou swarest unto David in
Thy truth? Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>

have reproached the change of Thy Christ."<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id="FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> Now it may
with very good reason be asked whether this is spoken in the
person of those Israelites who desired that the promise made
to David might be fulfilled to them; or rather of the Christians,
who are Israelites not after the flesh but after the
Spirit.<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id="FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> This certainly was spoken or written in the time of
Ethan, from whose name this psalm gets its title, and that
was the same as the time of David's reign; and therefore it
would not have been said, "Where are Thine ancient compassions,
Lord, which Thou hast sworn unto David in Thy
truth?" unless the prophet had assumed the person of those
who should come long afterwards, to whom that time when
these things were promised to David was ancient. But it
may be understood thus, that many nations, when they persecuted
the Christians, reproached them with the passion of
Christ, which Scripture calls His change, because by dying
He is made immortal. The change of Christ, according to
this passage, may also be understood to be reproached by the
Israelites, because, when they hoped He would be theirs, He
was made the Saviour of the nations; and many nations who
have believed in Him by the New Testament now reproach
them who remain in the old with this: so that it is said, "Remember,
Lord, the reproach of Thy servants;" because through
the Lord's not forgetting, but rather pitying them, even they
after this reproach are to believe. But what I have put first
seems to me the most suitable meaning. For to the enemies
of Christ who are reproached with this, that Christ hath left
them, turning to the Gentiles,<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> this speech is incongruously
assigned, "Remember, Lord, the reproach of Thy servants,"
for such Jews are not to be styled the servants of God; but
these words fit those who, if they suffered great humiliations
through persecution for the name of Christ, could call to mind
that an exalted kingdom had been promised to the seed of
David, and in desire of it, could say not despairingly, but as
asking, seeking, knocking,<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> "Where are Thine ancient compassions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
Lord, which Thou swarest unto David in Thy truth? Remember,
Lord, the reproach of Thy servants, that I have borne
in my bosom of many nations;" that is, have patiently endured
in my inward parts. "That Thine enemies have reproached,
O Lord, wherewith they have reproached the change of Thy
Christ," not thinking it a change, but a consumption.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> But what
does "Remember, Lord," mean, but that Thou wouldst have
compassion, and wouldst for my patiently borne humiliation
reward me with the excellency which Thou swarest unto David
in Thy truth? But if we assign these words to the Jews,
those servants of God who, on the conquest of the earthly
Jerusalem, before Jesus Christ was born after the manner of
men, were led into captivity, could say such things, understanding
the change of Christ, because indeed through Him
was to be surely expected, not an earthly and carnal felicity,
such as appeared during the few years of king Solomon, but a
heavenly and spiritual felicity; and when the nations, then
ignorant of this through unbelief, exulted over and insulted
the people of God for being captives, what else was this than
ignorantly to reproach with the change of Christ those who
understand the change of Christ? And therefore what follows
when this psalm is concluded, "Let the blessing of the
Lord be for evermore, amen, amen," is suitable enough for
the whole people of God belonging to the heavenly Jerusalem,
whether for those things that lay hid in the Old Testament
before the New was revealed, or for those that, being now
revealed in the New Testament, are manifestly discerned to
belong to Christ. For the blessing of the Lord in the seed of
David does not belong to any particular time, such as appeared
in the days of Solomon, but is for evermore to be
hoped for, in which most certain hope it is said, "Amen,
amen;" for this repetition of the word is the confirmation of
that hope. Therefore David understanding this, says in the
second Book of Kings, in the passage from which we digressed
to this psalm,<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> "Thou hast spoken also for Thy servant's house
for a great while to come."<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a> Therefore also a little after he
says, "Now begin, and bless the house of Thy servant for evermore,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
etc., because the son was then about to be born from
whom his posterity should be continued to Christ, through
whom his house should be eternal, and should also be the
house of God. For it is called the house of David on account
of David's race; but the selfsame is called the house of God
on account of the temple of God, made of men, not of stones,
where shall dwell for evermore the people with and in their
God, and God with and in His people, so that God may fill
His people, and the people be filled with their God, while God
shall be all in all, Himself their reward in peace who is their
strength in war. Therefore, when it is said in the words of
Nathan, "And the Lord will tell thee what an house thou
shalt build for Him,"<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> it is afterwards said in the words of
David, "For Thou, Lord Almighty, God of Israel, hast opened
the ear of Thy servant, saying, I will build thee an house."<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a>
For this house is built both by us through living well, and by
God through helping us to live well; for "except the Lord
build the house, they labour in vain that build it."<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> And
when the final dedication of this house shall take place, then
what God here says by Nathan shall be fulfilled, "And I
will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant him,
and he shall dwell apart, and shall be troubled no more; and
the son of iniquity shall not humble him any more, as from
the beginning, from the days when I appointed judges over my
people Israel."<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Whether the truth of this promised peace can be ascribed to those times
passed away under Solomon.</i></p>

<p>Whoever hopes for this so great good in this world, and
in this earth, his wisdom is but folly. Can any one think it
was fulfilled in the peace of Solomon's reign? Scripture certainly
commends that peace with excellent praise as a shadow
of that which is to come. But this opinion is to be vigilantly
opposed, since after it is said, "And the son of iniquity shall
not humble him any more," it is immediately added, "as from
the beginning, from the days in which I appointed judges
over my people Israel."<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> For the judges were appointed over
that people from the time when they received the land of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
promise, before kings had begun to be there. And certainly
the son of iniquity, that is, the foreign enemy, humbled him
through periods of time in which we read that peace alternated
with wars; and in that period longer times of peace are
found than Solomon had, who reigned forty years. For under
that judge who is called Ehud there were eighty years of
peace.<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> Be it far from us, therefore, that we should believe
the times of Solomon are predicted in this promise, much less
indeed those of any other king whatever. For none other of
them reigned in such great peace as he; nor did that nation
ever at all hold that kingdom so as to have no anxiety lest it
should be subdued by enemies: for in the very great mutability
of human affairs such great security is never given to
any people, that it should not dread invasions hostile to this
life. Therefore the place of this promised peaceful and secure
habitation is eternal, and of right belongs eternally to Jerusalem
the free mother, where the genuine people of Israel
shall be: for this name is interpreted "Seeing God;" in the
desire of which reward a pious life is to be led through faith
in this miserable pilgrimage.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a></p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of David's concern in the writing of the Psalms.</i></p>

<p>In the progress of the city of God through the ages, therefore,
David first reigned in the earthly Jerusalem as a shadow
of that which was to come. Now David was a man skilled
in songs, who dearly loved musical harmony, not with a
vulgar delight, but with a believing disposition, and by it
served his God, who is the true God, by the mystical representation
of a great thing. For the rational and well-ordered
concord of diverse sounds in harmonious variety suggests the
compact unity of the well-ordered city. Then almost all his
prophecy is in psalms, of which a hundred and fifty are contained
in what we call the Book of Psalms, of which some
will have it those only were made by David which are inscribed
with his name. But there are also some who think
none of them were made by him except those which are
marked "Of David;" but those which have in the title "For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
David" have been made by others who assumed his person.
Which opinion is refuted by the voice of the Saviour
Himself in the Gospel, when He says that David himself
by the Spirit said Christ was his Lord; for the 110th Psalm
begins thus, "The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my
right hand, until I make Thine enemies Thy footstool."<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> And
truly that very psalm, like many more, has in the title, not
"of David," but "for David." But those seem to me to hold
the more credible opinion, who ascribe to him the authorship
of all these hundred and fifty psalms, and think that he prefixed
to some of them the names even of other men, who
prefigured something pertinent to the matter, but chose to
have no man's name in the titles of the rest, just as God
inspired him in the management of this variety, which,
although dark, is not meaningless. Neither ought it to move
one not to believe this, that the names of some prophets who
lived long after the times of king David are read in the
inscriptions of certain psalms in that book, and that the
things said there seem to be spoken as it were by them.
Nor was the prophetic Spirit unable to reveal to king David,
when he prophesied, even these names of future prophets, so
that he might prophetically sing something which should suit
their persons; just as it was revealed to a certain prophet
that king Josiah should arise and reign after more than three
hundred years, who predicted his future deeds also along with
his name.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Whether all the things prophesied in the Psalms concerning Christ and His
Church should be taken up in the text of this work.</i></p>

<p>And now I see it may be expected of me that I shall open
up in this part of this book what David may have prophesied
in the Psalms concerning the Lord Jesus Christ or His
Church. But although I have already done so in one instance,
I am prevented from doing as that expectation seems
to demand, rather by the abundance than the scarcity of
matter. For the necessity of shunning prolixity forbids my
setting down all things; yet I fear lest if I select some I shall
appear to many, who know these things, to have passed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the more necessary. Besides, the proof that is adduced ought
to be supported by the context of the whole psalm, so that
at least there may be nothing against it if everything does
not support it; lest we should seem, after the fashion of the
centos, to gather for the thing we wish, as it were verses out
of a grand poem, what shall be found to have been written
not about it, but about some other and widely different thing.
But ere this could be pointed out in each psalm, the whole
of it must be expounded; and how great a work that would
be, the volumes of others, as well as our own, in which we
have done it, show well enough. Let him then who will,
or can, read these volumes, and he will find out how many
and great things David, at once king and prophet, has prophesied
concerning Christ and His Church, to wit, concerning
the King and the city which He has built.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of the things pertaining to Christ and the Church, said either openly or
tropically in the</i> 45<i>th Psalm.</i></p>

<p>For whatever direct and manifest prophetic utterances there
may be about anything, it is necessary that those which are
tropical should be mingled with them; which, chiefly on
account of those of slower understanding, thrust upon the
more learned the laborious task of clearing up and expounding
them. Some of them, indeed, on the very first blush, as
soon as they are spoken, exhibit Christ and the Church,
although some things in them that are less intelligible remain
to be expounded at leisure. We have an example of this
in that same Book of Psalms: "My heart bubbled up a good
matter: I utter my words to the king. My tongue is the pen
of a scribe, writing swiftly. Thy form is beautiful beyond the
sons of men; grace is poured out in Thy lips: therefore God
hath blessed Thee for evermore. Gird Thy sword about Thy
thigh, O Most Mighty. With Thy goodliness and Thy beauty
go forward, proceed prosperously, and reign, because of Thy
truth, and meekness, and righteousness; and Thy right hand
shall lead Thee forth wonderfully. Thy sharp arrows are most
powerful. The people shall fall under Thee: in the heart of
the King's enemies. Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever:
a rod of direction is the rod of Thy kingdom. Thou hast
loved righteousness, and hast hated iniquity: therefore God,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the oil of exultation above
Thy fellows. Myrrh and drops, and cassia from Thy vestments,
from the houses of ivory: out of which the daughters
of kings have delighted Thee in Thine honour."<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> Who is there,
no matter how slow, but must here recognise Christ whom
we preach, and in whom we believe, if he hears that He
is God, whose throne is for ever and ever, and that He is
anointed by God, as God indeed anoints, not with a visible,
but with a spiritual and intelligible chrism? For who is so
untaught in this religion, or so deaf to its far and wide spread
fame, as not to know that Christ is named from this chrism,
that is, from this anointing? But when it is acknowledged
that this King is Christ, let each one who is already subject to
Him who reigns because of truth, meekness, and righteousness,
inquire at his leisure into these other things that are here
said tropically: how His form is beautiful beyond the sons
of men, with a certain beauty that is the more to be loved
and admired the less it is corporeal; and what His sword,
arrows, and other things of that kind may be, which are set
down, not properly, but tropically.</p>

<p>Then let him look upon His Church, joined to her so great
Husband in spiritual marriage and divine love, of which it is
said in these words which follow, "The queen stood upon
Thy right hand in gold-embroidered vestments, girded about
with variety. Hearken, O daughter, and look, and incline
thine ear; forget also thy people, and thy father's house.
Because the King hath greatly desired thy beauty; for He is
the Lord thy God. And the daughters of Tyre shall worship
Him with gifts; the rich among the people shall entreat Thy
face. The daughter of the King has all her glory within, in
golden fringes, girded about with variety. The virgins shall
be brought after her to the King: her neighbours shall be
brought to Thee. They shall be brought with gladness and
exultation: they shall be led into the temple of the King.
Instead of thy fathers, sons shall be born to thee: thou shalt
establish them as princes over all the earth. They shall be
mindful of thy name in every generation and descent. Therefore
shall the people acknowledge thee for evermore, even for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> I do not think any one is so stupid as to
believe that some poor woman is here praised and described,
as the spouse, to wit, of Him to whom it is said, "Thy throne,
O God, is for ever and ever: a rod of direction is the rod of
Thy kingdom. Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity:
therefore God, Thy God, hath anointed Thee with the
oil of exultation above Thy fellows;"<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> that is, plainly, Christ
above Christians. For these are His fellows, out of the unity
and concord of whom in all nations that queen is formed,
as it is said of her in another psalm, "The city of the great
King."<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> The same is Sion spiritually, which name in Latin
is interpreted <i>speculatio</i> (discovery); for she descries the
great good of the world to come, because her attention is
directed thither. In the same way she is also Jerusalem
spiritually, of which we have already said many things. Her
enemy is the city of the devil, Babylon, which is interpreted
"confusion." Yet out of this Babylon this queen is in all
nations set free by regeneration, and passes from the worst
to the best King,&mdash;that is, from the devil to Christ. Wherefore
it is said to her, "Forget thy people and thy father's
house." Of this impious city those also are a portion who
are Israelites only in the flesh and not by faith, enemies also
of this great King Himself, and of His queen. For Christ,
having come to them, and been slain by them, has the more
become the King of others, whom He did not see in the flesh.
Whence our King Himself says through the prophecy of a
certain psalm, "Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions
of the people; Thou wilt make me head of the nations. A
people whom I have not known hath served me: in the hearing
of the ear it hath obeyed me."<a name="FNanchor_450_450" id="FNanchor_450_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_450" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> Therefore this people of
the nations, which Christ did not know in His bodily presence,
yet has believed in that Christ as announced to it; so that it
might be said of it with good reason, "In the hearing of the
ear it hath obeyed me," for "faith is by hearing."<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> This
people, I say, added to those who are the true Israelites both
by the flesh and by faith, is the city of God, which has
brought forth Christ Himself according to the flesh, since He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
was in these Israelites only. For thence came the Virgin
Mary, in whom Christ assumed flesh that He might be man.
Of which city another psalm says, "Mother Sion, shall a man
say, and the man is made in her, and the Highest Himself
hath founded her."<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Who is this Highest, save God? And
thus Christ, who is God, before He became man through Mary
in that city, Himself founded it by the patriarchs and prophets.
As therefore was said by prophecy so long before to this queen,
the city of God, what we already can see fulfilled, "Instead
of thy fathers, sons are born to thee; thou shalt make them
princes over all the earth;"<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> so out of her sons truly are set
up even her fathers [princes] through all the earth, when the
people, coming together to her, confess to her with the confession
of eternal praise for ever and ever. Beyond doubt,
whatever interpretation is put on what is here expressed
somewhat darkly in figurative language, ought to be in agreement
with these most manifest things.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of those things in the</i> 110<i>th Psalm which relate to the priesthood of Christ,
and in the</i> 22<i>d to His passion.</i></p>

<p>Just as in that psalm also where Christ is most openly
proclaimed as Priest, even as He is here as King, "The Lord
said unto my Lord, Sit Thou at my right hand, until I make
Thine enemies Thy footstool."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a> That Christ sits on the right
hand of God the Father is believed, not seen; that His enemies
also are put under His feet doth not yet appear; it is
being done, [therefore] it will appear at last: yea, this is now
believed, afterward it shall be seen. But what follows, "The
Lord will send forth the rod of Thy strength out of Sion, and
rule Thou in the midst of Thine enemies,"<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a> is so clear, that to
deny it would imply not merely unbelief and mistake, but
downright impudence. And even enemies must certainly
confess that out of Sion has been sent the law of Christ which
we call the gospel, and acknowledge as the rod of His strength.
But that He rules in the midst of His enemies, these same
enemies among whom He rules themselves bear witness,
gnashing their teeth and consuming away, and having power
to do nothing against Him. Then what he says a little after,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
"The Lord hath sworn and will not repent,"<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> by which words
He intimates that what He adds is immutable, "Thou art a
priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek,"<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> who is permitted
to doubt of whom these things are said, seeing that
now there is nowhere a priesthood and sacrifice after the
order of Aaron, and everywhere men offer under Christ as the
Priest, which Melchizedek showed when he blessed Abraham?
Therefore to these manifest things are to be referred, when
rightly understood, those things in the same psalm that are set
down a little more obscurely, and we have already made known
in our popular sermons how these things are to be rightly understood.
So also in that where Christ utters through prophecy
the humiliation of His passion, saying, "They pierced my
hands and feet; they counted all my bones. Yea, they looked
and stared at me."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> By which words he certainly meant His
body stretched out on the cross, with the hands and feet pierced
and perforated by the striking through of the nails, and that
He had in that way made Himself a spectacle to those who
looked and stared. And he adds, "They parted my garments
among them, and over my vesture they cast lots."<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a> How
this prophecy has been fulfilled the Gospel history narrates.
Then, indeed, the other things also which are said there less
openly are rightly understood when they agree with those
which shine with so great clearness; especially because those
things also which we do not believe as past, but survey as
present, are beheld by the whole world, being now exhibited
just as they are read of in this very psalm as predicted so
long before. For it is there said a little after, "All the ends
of the earth shall remember, and turn unto the Lord, and all
the kindreds of the nations shall worship before Him; for the
kingdom is the Lord's, and He shall rule the nations."</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of the</i> 3<i>d</i>, 41<i>st</i>, 15<i>th</i>, <i>and</i> 68<i>th Psalms, in which the death and resurrection
of the Lord are prophesied.</i></p>

<p>About His resurrection also the oracles of the Psalms are
by no means silent. For what else is it that is sung in His
person in the 3d Psalm, "I laid me down and took a sleep,
[and] I awaked, for the Lord shall sustain me?"<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> Is there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
perchance any one so stupid as to believe that the prophet
chose to point it out to us as something great that He had
slept and risen up, unless that sleep had been death, and that
awaking the resurrection, which behoved to be thus prophesied
concerning Christ? For in the 41st Psalm also it is
shown much more clearly, where in the person of the Mediator,
in the usual way, things are narrated as if past which were
prophesied as yet to come, since these things which were yet
to come were in the predestination and foreknowledge of God
as if they were done, because they were certain. He says,
"Mine enemies speak evil of me; When shall he die, and his
name perish? And if he came in to see me, his heart spake
vain things: he gathered iniquity to himself. He went out
of doors, and uttered it all at once. Against me all mine
enemies whisper together: against me do they devise evil.
They have planned an unjust thing against me. Shall not
he that sleeps also rise again?"<a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> These words are certainly
so set down here that he may be understood to say nothing
else than if he said, Shall not He that died recover life again?
The previous words clearly show that His enemies have meditated
and planned His death, and that this was executed by
him who came in to see, and went out to betray. But to
whom does not Judas here occur, who, from being His disciple,
became His betrayer? Therefore because they were
about to do what they had plotted,&mdash;that is, were about to
kill Him,&mdash;he, to show them that with useless malice they
were about to kill Him who should rise again, so adds this
verse, as if he said, What vain thing are you doing? What
will be your crime will be my sleep. "Shall not He that
sleeps also rise again?" And yet he indicates in the following
verses that they should not commit so great an impiety
with impunity, saying, "Yea, the man of my peace in whom
I trusted, who ate my bread, hath enlarged the heel over
me;"<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a> that is, hath trampled me under foot. "But Thou," he
saith, "O Lord, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
may requite them."<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a> Who can now deny this who sees the
Jews, after the passion and resurrection of Christ, utterly
rooted up from their abodes by warlike slaughter and destruction?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
For, being slain by them, He has risen again, and
has requited them meanwhile by temporary discipline, save
that for those who are not corrected He keeps it in store for
the time when He shall judge the quick and the dead.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> For
the Lord Jesus Himself, in pointing out that very man to the
apostles as His betrayer, quoted this very verse of this psalm,
and said it was fulfilled in Himself: "He that ate my bread
enlarged the heel over me." But what he says, "In whom I
trusted," does not suit the head but the body. For the
Saviour Himself was not ignorant of him concerning whom
He had already said before, "One of you is a devil."<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> But
He is wont to assume the person of His members, and to
ascribe to Himself what should be said of them, because the
head and the body is one Christ;<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a> whence that saying in the
Gospel, "I was an hungered, and ye gave me to eat."<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a> Expounding
which, He says, "Since ye did it to one of the least
of mine, ye did it to me."<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> Therefore He said that He had
trusted, because His disciples then had trusted concerning
Judas; for he was numbered with the apostles.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id="FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class="fnanchor">[469]</a></p>

<p>But the Jews do not expect that the Christ whom they
expect will die; therefore they do not think ours to be Him
whom the law and the prophets announced, but feign to
themselves I know not whom of their own, exempt from the
suffering of death. Therefore, with wonderful emptiness and
blindness, they contend that the words we have set down
signify, not death and resurrection, but sleep and awaking
again. But the 16th Psalm also cries to them, "Therefore
my heart is jocund, and my tongue hath exulted; moreover,
my flesh also shall rest in hope: for Thou wilt not leave my
soul in hell; neither wilt Thou give Thine Holy One to see
corruption."<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> Who but He that rose again the third day
could say His flesh had rested in this hope; that His soul,
not being left in hell, but speedily returning to it, should
revive it, that it should not be corrupted as corpses are wont
to be, which they can in no wise say of David the prophet and
king? The 68th Psalm also cries out, "Our God is the God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
of salvation: even of the Lord the exit was by death."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> What
could be more openly said? For the God of salvation is the
Lord Jesus, which is interpreted Saviour, or Healing One. For
this reason this name was given, when it was said before He was
born of the virgin: "Thou shalt bring forth a Son, and shalt
call His name Jesus; for He shall save His people from their
sins."<a name="FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> Because His blood was shed for the remission of their
sins, it behoved Him to have no other exit from this life than
death. Therefore, when it had been said, "Our God is the God
of salvation," immediately it was added, "Even of the Lord the
exit was by death," in order to show that we were to be saved
by His dying. But that saying is marvellous, "Even of the
Lord," as if it was said, Such is that life of mortals, that not
even the Lord Himself could go out of it otherwise save
through death.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of the</i> 69<i>th Psalm, in which the obstinate unbelief of the Jews is
declared.</i></p>

<p>But when the Jews will not in the least yield to the testimonies
of this prophecy, which are so manifest, and are also
brought by events to so clear and certain a completion, certainly
that is fulfilled in them which is written in that psalm
which here follows. For when the things which pertain to
His passion are prophetically spoken there also in the person,
of Christ, that is mentioned which is unfolded in the Gospel:
"They gave me gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
me vinegar for drink."<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> And as it were after such a feast
and dainties in this way given to Himself, presently He
brings in [these words]: "Let their table become a trap before
them, and a retribution, and an offence: let their eyes be
dimmed that they see not, and their back be always bowed
down,"<a name="FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> etc. Which things are not spoken as wished for,
but are predicted under the prophetic form of wishing. What
wonder, then, if those whose eyes are dimmed that they see
not do not see these manifest things? What wonder if
those do not look up at heavenly things whose back is always
bowed down that they may grovel among earthly things?
For these words transferred from the body signify mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
faults. Let these things which have been said about the
Psalms, that is, about king David's prophecy, suffice, that we
may keep within some bound. But let those readers excuse us
who knew them all before; and let them not complain about
those perhaps stronger proofs which they know or think I
have passed by.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>20. <i>Of David's reign and merit; and of his son Solomon, and that prophecy
relating to Christ which is found either in those books which are joined to
those written by him, or in those which are indubitably his.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>David therefore reigned in the earthly Jerusalem, a son
of the heavenly Jerusalem, much praised by the divine testimony;
for even his faults are overcome by great piety, through
the most salutary humility of his repentance, that he is altogether
one of those of whom he himself says, "Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered."<a name="FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
After him Solomon his son reigned over the same whole people,
who, as was said before, began to reign while his father was
still alive. This man, after good beginnings, made a bad end.
For indeed "prosperity, which wears out the minds of the wise,"<a name="FNanchor_476_476" id="FNanchor_476_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_476" class="fnanchor">[476]</a>
hurt him more than that wisdom profited him, which even
yet is and shall hereafter be renowned, and was then praised
far and wide. He also is found to have prophesied in his
books, of which three are received as of canonical authority,
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and the Song of Songs. But it has
been customary to ascribe to Solomon other two, of which one
is called Wisdom, the other Ecclesiasticus, on account of some
resemblance of style,&mdash;but the more learned have no doubt
that they are not his; yet of old the Church, especially
the Western, received them into authority,&mdash;in the one of
which, called the Wisdom of Solomon, the passion of Christ
is most openly prophesied. For indeed His impious murderers
are quoted as saying, "Let us lie in wait for the
righteous, for he is unpleasant to us, and contrary to our
works; and he upbraideth us with our transgressions of the
law, and objecteth to our disgrace the transgressions of our
education. He professeth to have the knowledge of God, and
he calleth himself the Son of God. He was made to reprove
our thoughts. He is grievous for us even to behold; for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
life is unlike other men's, and his ways are different. We
are esteemed of him as counterfeits; and he abstaineth from
our ways as from filthiness. He extols the latter end of the
righteous; and glorieth that he hath God for his Father. Let
us see, therefore, if his words be true; and let us try what
shall happen to him, and we shall know what shall be the
end of him. For if the righteous be the Son of God, He will
undertake for him, and deliver him out of the hand of those
that are against him. Let us put him to the question with
contumely and torture, that we may know his reverence, and
prove his patience. Let us condemn him to the most shameful
death; for by His own sayings He shall be respected.
These things did they imagine, and were mistaken; for their
own malice hath quite blinded them."<a name="FNanchor_477_477" id="FNanchor_477_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_477" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> But in Ecclesiasticus
the future faith of the nations is predicted in this manner:
"Have mercy upon us, O God, Ruler of all, and send Thy fear
upon all the nations: lift up Thine hand over the strange
nations, and let them see Thy power. As Thou wast sanctified
in us before them, so be Thou sanctified in them before
us, and let them acknowledge Thee, according as we also have
acknowledged Thee; for there is not a God beside Thee, O
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_478_478" id="FNanchor_478_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_478" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> We see this prophecy in the form of a wish and
prayer fulfilled through Jesus Christ. But the things which
are not written in the canon of the Jews cannot be quoted
against their contradictions with so great validity.</p>

<p>But as regards those three books which it is evident are
Solomon's, and held canonical by the Jews, to show what of
this kind may be found in them pertaining to Christ and the
Church demands a laborious discussion, which, if now entered
on, would lengthen this work unduly. Yet what we read in
the Proverbs of impious men saying, "Let us unrighteously
hide in the earth the righteous man; yea, let us swallow him
up alive as hell, and let us take away his memory from the
earth: let us seize his precious possession,"<a name="FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_479" class="fnanchor">[479]</a> is not so obscure
that it may not be understood, without laborious exposition,
of Christ and His possession the Church. Indeed, the gospel
parable about the wicked husbandmen shows that our Lord
Jesus Himself said something like it: "This is the heir; come,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours."<a name="FNanchor_480_480" id="FNanchor_480_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_480" class="fnanchor">[480]</a> In like
manner also that passage in this same book, on which we have
already touched<a name="FNanchor_481_481" id="FNanchor_481_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_481" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> when we were speaking of the barren woman
who hath born seven, must soon after it was uttered have
come to be understood of only Christ and the Church by those
who knew that Christ was the Wisdom of God. "Wisdom
hath builded her an house, and hath set up seven pillars; she
hath sacrificed her victims, she hath mingled her wine in the
bowl; she hath also furnished her table. She hath sent her
servants summoning to the bowl with excellent proclamation,
saying, Who is simple, let him turn aside to me. And
to the void of sense she hath said, Come, eat of my bread,
and drink of the wine which I have mingled for you."<a name="FNanchor_482_482" id="FNanchor_482_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_482" class="fnanchor">[482]</a> Here
certainly we perceive that the Wisdom of God, that is, the
Word co-eternal with the Father, hath builded Him an house,
even a human body in the virgin womb, and hath subjoined
the Church to it as members to a head, hath slain the martyrs
as victims, hath furnished a table with wine and bread, where
appears also the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek, and
hath called the simple and the void of sense, because, as saith
the apostle, "He hath chosen the weak things of this world
that He might confound the things which are mighty."<a name="FNanchor_483_483" id="FNanchor_483_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_483" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Yet
to these weak ones she saith what follows, "Forsake simplicity,
that ye may live; and seek prudence, that ye may have
life."<a name="FNanchor_484_484" id="FNanchor_484_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_484" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> But to be made partakers of this table is itself to
begin to have life. For when he says in another book, which
is called Ecclesiastes, "There is no good for a man, except
that he should eat and drink,"<a name="FNanchor_485_485" id="FNanchor_485_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_485" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> what can he be more credibly
understood to say, than what belongs to the participation of
this table which the Mediator of the New Testament Himself,
the Priest after the order of Melchizedek, furnishes with His
own body and blood? For that sacrifice has succeeded all
the sacrifices of the Old Testament, which were slain as a
shadow of that which was to come; wherefore also we recognise
the voice in the 40th Psalm as that of the same
Mediator speaking through prophesy, "Sacrifice and offering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Thou didst not desire; but a body hast Thou perfected for me."<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id="FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class="fnanchor">[486]</a>
Because, instead of all these sacrifices and oblations, His body
is offered, and is served up to the partakers of it. For that
this Ecclesiastes, in this sentence about eating and drinking,
which he often repeats, and very much commends, does not
savour the dainties of carnal pleasures, is made plain enough
when he says, "It is better to go into the house of mourning
than to go into the house of feasting."<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id="FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> And a little after
He says, "The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning,
and the heart of the simple in the house of feasting."<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> But
I think that more worthy of quotation from this book which
relates to both cities, the one of the devil, the other of Christ,
and to their kings, the devil and Christ: "Woe to thee, O land,"
he says, "when thy king is a youth, and thy princes eat in
the morning! Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the
son of nobles, and thy princes eat in season, in fortitude, and
not in confusion!"<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">[489]</a> He has called the devil a youth, because
of the folly and pride, and rashness and unruliness, and other
vices which are wont to abound at that age; but Christ is the
Son of nobles, that is, of the holy patriarchs, of those belonging
to the free city, of whom He was begotten in the flesh.
The princes of that and other cities are eaters in the morning,
that is, before the suitable hour, because they do not expect
the seasonable felicity, which is the true, in the world to come,
desiring to be speedily made happy with the renown of this
world, but the princes of the city of Christ patiently wait
for the time of a blessedness that is not fallacious. This is
expressed by the words, "in fortitude, and not in confusion,"
because hope does not deceive them, of which the apostle
says, "But hope maketh not ashamed."<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id="FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> A psalm also saith,
"For they that hope in Thee shall not be put to shame."<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_491" class="fnanchor">[491]</a>
But now the Song of Songs is a certain spiritual pleasure of
holy minds, in the marriage of that King and Queen-city, that
is, Christ and the Church. But this pleasure is wrapped up
in allegorical veils, that the Bridegroom may be more ardently
desired, and more joyfully unveiled, and may appear; to whom
it is said in this same song, "Equity hath delighted Thee;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_492_492" id="FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class="fnanchor">[492]</a>
and the bride who those hears, "Charity is in thy delights."<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id="FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class="fnanchor">[493]</a>
We pass over many things in silence, in our desire to finish
this work.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the kings after Solomon, both in Judah and Israel.</i></p>

<p>The other kings of the Hebrews after Solomon are scarcely
found to have prophesied, through certain enigmatic words or
actions of theirs, what may pertain to Christ and the Church,
either in Judah or Israel; for so were the parts of that
people styled, when, on account of Solomon's offence, from the
time of Rehoboam his son, who succeeded him in the kingdom,
it was divided by God as a punishment. The ten tribes,
indeed, which Jeroboam the servant of Solomon received,
being appointed the king in Samaria, were distinctively called
Israel, although this had been the name of that whole people;
but the two tribes, namely, of Judah and Benjamin, which for
David's sake, lest the kingdom should be wholly wrenched
from his race, remained subject to the city of Jerusalem,
were called Judah, because that was the tribe whence David
sprang. But Benjamin, the other tribe which, as was said,
belonged to the same kingdom, was that whence Saul sprang
before David. But these two tribes together, as was said,
were called Judah, and were distinguished by this name from
Israel, which was the distinctive title of the ten tribes under
their own king. For the tribe of Levi, because it was the
priestly one, bound to the servitude of God, not of the kings,
was reckoned the thirteenth. For Joseph, one of the twelve
sons of Israel, did not, like the others, form one tribe, but two,
Ephraim and Manasseh. Yet the tribe of Levi also belonged
more to the kingdom of Jerusalem, where was the temple of
God whom it served. On the division of the people, therefore,
Rehoboam, son of Solomon, reigned in Jerusalem as the
first king of Judah, and Jeroboam, servant of Solomon, in
Samaria as king of Israel. And when Rehoboam wished as
a tyrant to pursue that separated part with war, the people
were prohibited from fighting with their brethren by God, who
told them through a prophet that He had done this; whence
it appeared that in this matter there had been no sin either
of the king or people of Israel, but the accomplished will of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
God the avenger. When this was known, both parts settled
down peaceably, for the division made was not religious but
political.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>22. <i>Of Jeroboam, who profaned the people put under him by the impiety of
idolatry, amid which, however, God did not cease to inspire the prophets,
and to guard many from the crime of idolatry.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But Jeroboam king of Israel, with perverse mind, not believing
in God, whom he had proved true in promising and
giving him the kingdom, was afraid lest, by coming to the
temple of God which was in Jerusalem, where, according to
the divine law, that whole nation was to come in order to
sacrifice, the people should be seduced from him, and return
to David's line as the seed royal; and set up idolatry in
his kingdom, and with horrible impiety beguiled the people,
ensnaring them to the worship of idols with himself. Yet
God did not altogether cease to reprove by the prophets, not
only that king, but also his successors and imitators in his
impiety, and the people too. For there the great and illustrious
prophets Elijah and Elisha his disciple arose, who also
did many wonderful works. Even there, when Elijah said,
"O Lord, they have slain Thy prophets, they have digged
down Thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my
life," it was answered that seven thousand men were there
who had not bowed the knee to Baal.<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id="FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class="fnanchor">[494]</a></p>

both were at different times led into captivity, Judah being afterwards

<p>So also in the kingdom of Judah pertaining to Jerusalem
prophets were not lacking even in the times of succeeding
kings, just as it pleased God to send them, either for the
prediction of what was needful, or for correction of sin and
instruction in righteousness;<a name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> for there, too, although far less
than in Israel, kings arose who grievously offended God by
their impieties, and, along with their people, who were like
them, were smitten with moderate scourges. The no small
merits of the pious kings there are praised indeed. But we
read that in Israel the kings were, some more, others less, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
all wicked. Each part, therefore, as the divine providence
either ordered or permitted, was both lifted up by prosperity
and weighed down by adversity of various kinds; and it was
afflicted not only by foreign, but also by civil wars with each
other, in order that by certain existing causes the mercy or
anger of God might be manifested; until, by His growing indignation,
that whole nation was by the conquering Chaldeans
not only overthrown in its abode, but also for the most part
transported to the lands of the Assyrians,&mdash;first, that part of
the thirteen tribes called Israel, but afterwards Judah also,
when Jerusalem and that most noble temple was cast down,&mdash;in
which lands it rested seventy years in captivity. Being
after that time sent forth thence, they rebuilt the overthrown
temple. And although very many stayed in the lands of the
strangers, yet the kingdom no longer had two separate parts,
with different kings over each, but in Jerusalem there was
one prince over them; and at certain times, from every direction
wherever they were, and from whatever place they could,
they all came to the temple of God which was there. Yet
not even then were they without foreign enemies and conquerors;
yea, Christ found them tributaries of the Romans.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Of the prophets, who either were the last among the Jews, or whom the
gospel history reports about the time of Christ's nativity.</i></p>

<p>But in that whole time after they returned from Babylon,
after Malachi, Haggai, and Zechariah, who then prophesied,
and Ezra, they had no prophets down to the time of the
Saviour's advent except another Zechariah, the father of John,
and Elisabeth his wife, when the nativity of Christ was already
close at hand; and when He was already born, Simeon the
aged, and Anna a widow, and now very old; and, last of all,
John himself, who, being a young man, did not predict that
Christ, now a young man, was to come, but by prophetic knowledge
pointed Him out although unknown; for which reason
the Lord Himself says, "The law and the prophets were until
John."<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id="FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> But the prophesying of these five is made known to
us in the gospel, where the virgin mother of our Lord herself
is also found to have prophesied before John. But this
prophecy of theirs the wicked Jews do not receive; but those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
innumerable persons received it who from them believed the
gospel. For then truly Israel was divided in two, by that
division which was foretold by Samuel the prophet to king
Saul as immutable. But even the reprobate Jews hold
Malachi, Haggai, Zechariah, and Ezra as the last received into
canonical authority. For there are also writings of these, as
of others, who being but a very few in the great multitude
of prophets, have written those books which have obtained
canonical authority, of whose predictions it seems good to me
to put in this work some which pertain to Christ and His
Church; and this, by the Lord's help, shall be done more conveniently
in the following book, that we may not further
burden this one, which is already too long.</p>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>AUGUSTINE TRACES THE PARALLEL COURSES OF THE EARTHLY AND HEAVENLY
CITIES FROM THE TIME OF ABRAHAM TO THE END OF THE WORLD; AND
ALLUDES TO THE ORACLES REGARDING CHRIST, BOTH THOSE UTTERED BY
THE SIBYLS, AND THOSE OF THE SACRED PROPHETS WHO WROTE AFTER
THE FOUNDATION OF ROME, HOSEA, AMOS, ISAIAH, MICAH, AND THEIR SUCCESSORS.</p></blockquote>


<p class="center">1. <i>Of those things down to the times of the Saviour which have been discussed
in the seventeen books.</i></p>

<p>I promised to write of the rise, progress, and appointed
end of the two cities, one of which is God's, the other
this world's, in which, so far as mankind is concerned, the
former is now a stranger. But first of all I undertook, so far
as His grace should enable me, to refute the enemies of the
city of God, who prefer their gods to Christ its founder, and
fiercely hate Christians with the most deadly malice. And
this I have done in the first ten books. Then, as regards my
threefold promise which I have just mentioned, I have treated
distinctly, in the four books which follow the tenth, of the
rise of both cities. After that, I have proceeded from the
first man down to the flood in one book, which is the fifteenth
of this work; and from that again down to Abraham our
work has followed both in chronological order. From the
patriarch Abraham down to the time of the Israelite kings, at
which we close our sixteenth book, and thence down to the
advent of Christ Himself in the flesh, to which period the
seventeenth book reaches, the city of God appears from my
way of writing to have run its course alone; whereas it did
not run its course alone in this age, for both cities, in their
course amid mankind, certainly experienced chequered times
together just as from the beginning. But I did this in order
that, first of all, from the time when the promises of God
began to be more clear, down to the virgin birth of Him
in whom those things promised from the first were to be fulfilled,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
the course of that city which is God's might be made
more distinctly apparent, without interpolation of foreign
matter from the history of the other city, although down to
the revelation of the new covenant it ran its course, not in
light, but in shadow. Now, therefore, I think fit to do what I
passed by, and show, so far as seems necessary, how that other
city ran its course from the times of Abraham, so that attentive
readers may compare the two.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of the kings and times of the earthly city which were synchronous with the
times of the saints, reckoning from the rise of Abraham.</i></p>

<p>The society of mortals spread abroad through the earth
everywhere, and in the most diverse places, although bound
together by a certain fellowship of our common nature, is yet
for the most part divided against itself, and the strongest
oppress the others, because all follow after their own interests
and lusts, while what is longed for either suffices for none,
or not for all, because it is not the very thing. For the vanquished
succumb to the victorious, preferring any sort of peace
and safety to freedom itself; so that they who chose to die
rather than be slaves have been greatly wondered at. For in
almost all nations the very voice of nature somehow proclaims,
that those who happen to be conquered should choose rather
to be subject to their conquerors than to be killed by all kinds
of warlike destruction. This does not take place without the
providence of God, in whose power it lies that any one either
subdues or is subdued in war; that some are endowed with
kingdoms, others made subject to kings. Now, among the
very many kingdoms of the earth into which, by earthly interest
or lust, society is divided (which we call by the general
name of the city of this world), we see that two, settled and
kept distinct from each other both in time and place, have
grown far more famous than the rest, first that of the Assyrians,
then that of the Romans. First came the one, then the other.
The former arose in the east, and, immediately on its close, the
latter in the west. I may speak of other kingdoms and other
kings as appendages of these.</p>

<p>Ninus, then, who succeeded his father Belus, the first king
of Assyria, was already the second king of that kingdom when
Abraham was born in the land of the Chaldees. There was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
also at that time a very small kingdom of Sicyon, with which,
as from an ancient date, that most universally learned man
Marcus Varro begins, in writing of the Roman race. For
from these kings of Sicyon he passes to the Athenians, from
them to the Latins, and from these to the Romans. Yet very
little is related about these kingdoms, before the foundation of
Rome, in comparison with that of Assyria. For although
even Sallust, the Roman historian, admits that the Athenians
were very famous in Greece, yet he thinks they were greater
in fame than in fact. For in speaking of them he says,
"The deeds of the Athenians, as I think, were very great and
magnificent, but yet somewhat less than reported by fame.
But because writers of great genius arose among them, the
deeds of the Athenians were celebrated throughout the world
as very great. Thus the virtue of those who did them was
held to be as great as men of transcendent genius could represent
it to be by the power of laudatory words."<a name="FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> This city
also derived no small glory from literature and philosophy, the
study of which chiefly flourished there. But as regards empire,
none in the earliest times was greater than the Assyrian,
or so widely extended. For when Ninus the son of Belus was
king, he is reported to have subdued the whole of Asia, even
to the boundaries of Libya, which as to number is called the
third part, but as to size is found to be the half of the whole
world. The Indians in the eastern regions were the only
people over whom he did not reign; but after his death Semiramis
his wife made war on them. Thus it came to pass
that all the people and kings in those countries were subject
to the kingdom and authority of the Assyrians, and did whatever
they were commanded. Now Abraham was born in that
kingdom among the Chaldees, in the time of Ninus. But
since Grecian affairs are much better known to us than
Assyrian, and those who have diligently investigated the antiquity
of the Roman nation's origin have followed the order of
time through the Greeks to the Latins, and from them to the
Romans, who themselves are Latins, we ought on this account,
where it is needful, to mention the Assyrian kings, that it may
appear how Babylon, like a first Rome, ran its course along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
with the city of God, which is a stranger in this world. But
the things proper for insertion in this work in comparing the
two cities, that is, the earthly and heavenly, ought to be taken
mostly from the Greek and Latin kingdoms, where Rome
herself is like a second Babylon.</p>

<p>At Abraham's birth, then, the second kings of Assyria and
Sicyon respectively were Ninus and Europs, the first having
been Belus and √Ügialeus. But when God promised Abraham,
on his departure from Babylonia, that he should become a
great nation, and that in his seed all nations of the earth
should be blessed, the Assyrians had their seventh king, the
Sicyons their fifth; for the son of Ninus reigned among them
after his mother Semiramis, who is said to have been put to
death by him for attempting to defile him by incestuously
lying with him. Some think that she founded Babylon, and
indeed she may have founded it anew. But we have told, in
the sixteenth book, when or by whom it was founded. Now
the son of Ninus and Semiramis, who succeeded his mother
in the kingdom, is also called Ninus by some, but by others
Ninias, a patronymic word. Telexion then held the kingdom
of the Sicyons. In his reign times were quiet and joyful to
such a degree, that after his death they worshipped him as a
god by offering sacrifices and by celebrating games, which are
said to have been first instituted on this occasion.</p>

<p>3. <i>What kings reigned in Assyria and Sicyon when, according to the promise,
Isaac was born to Abraham in his hundredth year, and when the twins
Esau and Jacob were born of Rebecca to Isaac in his sixtieth year.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In his times also, by the promise of God, Isaac, the son of
Abraham, was born to his father when he was a hundred
years old, of Sarah his wife, who, being barren and old, had
already lost hope of issue. Aralius was then the fifth king
of the Assyrians. To Isaac himself, in his sixtieth year, were
born twin-sons, Esau and Jacob, whom Rebecca his wife bore
to him, their grandfather Abraham, who died on completing
a hundred and seventy years, being still alive, and reckoning
his hundred and sixtieth year.<a name="FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">[498]</a> At that time there reigned
as the seventh kings,&mdash;among the Assyrians, that more ancient
Xerxes, who was also called Bal√¶us; and among the Sicyons,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
Thuriachus, or, as some write his name, Thurimachus. The
kingdom of Argos, in which Inachus reigned first, arose in
the time of Abraham's grandchildren. And I must not
omit what Varro relates, that the Sicyons were also wont to
sacrifice at the tomb of their seventh king Thuriachus. In
the reign of Armamitres in Assyria and Leucippus in Sicyon
as the eighth kings, and of Inachus as the first in Argos, God
spoke to Isaac, and promised the same two things to him as
to his father,&mdash;namely, the land of Canaan to his seed, and
the blessing of all nations in his seed. These same things
were promised to his son, Abraham's grandson, who was at
first called Jacob, afterwards Israel, when Belocus was the
ninth king of Assyria, and Phoroneus, the son of Inachus,
reigned as the second king of Argos, Leucippus still continuing
king of Sicyon. In those times, under the Argive king
Phoroneus, Greece was made more famous by the institution
of certain laws and judges. On the death of Phoroneus, his
younger brother Phegous built a temple at his tomb, in which
he was worshipped as God, and oxen were sacrificed to him. I
believe they thought him worthy of so great honour, because
in his part of the kingdom (for their father had divided his
territories between them, in which they reigned during his
life) he had founded chapels for the worship of the gods, and
had taught them to measure time by months and years, and
to that extent to keep count and reckoning of events. Men
still uncultivated, admiring him for these novelties, either
fancied he was, or resolved that he should be made, a god
after his death. Io also is said to have been the daughter
of Inachus, who was afterwards called Isis, when she was
worshipped in Egypt as a great goddess; although others
write that she came as a queen out of Ethiopia, and because
she ruled extensively and justly, and instituted for her subjects
letters and many useful things, such divine honour was
given her there after she died, that if any one said she had
been human, he was charged with a capital crime.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Of the times of Jacob and his son Joseph.</i></p>

<p>In the reign of Bal√¶us, the ninth king of Assyria, and
Mesappus, the eighth of Sicyon, who is said by some to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
been also called Cephisos (if indeed the same man had both
names, and those who put the other name in their writings
have not rather confounded him with another man), while
Apis was third king of Argos, Isaac died, a hundred and
eighty years old, and left his twin-sons a hundred and twenty
years old. Jacob, the younger of these, belonged to the
city of God about which we write (the elder being wholly
rejected), and had twelve sons, one of whom, called Joseph,
was sold by his brothers to merchants going down to Egypt,
while his grandfather Isaac was still alive. But when he
was thirty years of age, Joseph stood before Pharaoh, being
exalted out of the humiliation he endured, because, in divinely
interpreting the king's dreams, he foretold that there would
be seven years of plenty, the very rich abundance of which
would be consumed by seven other years of famine that
should follow. On this account the king made him ruler
over Egypt, liberating him from prison, into which he had
been thrown for keeping his chastity intact; for he bravely
preserved it from his mistress, who wickedly loved him, and
told lies to his weakly credulous master, and did not consent
to commit adultery with her, but fled from her, leaving his
garment in her hands when she laid hold of him. In the
second of the seven years of famine Jacob came down into
Egypt to his son with all he had, being a hundred and thirty
years old, as he himself said in answer to the king's question.
Joseph was then thirty-nine, if we add seven years of plenty
and two of famine to the thirty he reckoned when honoured
by the king.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of Apis king of Argos, whom the Egyptians called Serapis, and worshipped
with divine honours.</i></p>

<p>In these times Apis king of Argos crossed over into
Egypt in ships, and, on dying there, was made Serapis, the
chief god of all the Egyptians. Now Varro gives this very
ready reason why, after his death, he was called, not Apis, but
Serapis. The ark in which he was placed when dead, which
every one now calls a sarcophagus, was then called in Greek
&#963;&#959;&#961;&#8056;&#962;, and they began to worship him when buried in it before
his temple was built; and from Soros and Apis he was called
first [Sorosapis, or] Sorapis, and then Serapis, by changing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
letter, as easily happens. It was decreed regarding him also,
that whoever should say he had been a man should be capitally
punished. And since in every temple where Isis and
Serapis were worshipped there was also an image which, with
finger pressed on the lips, seemed to warn men to keep silence,
Varro thinks this signifies that it should be kept secret that
they had been human. But that bull which, with wonderful
folly, deluded Egypt nourished with abundant delicacies in
honour of him, was not called Serapis, but Apis, because they
worshipped him alive without a sarcophagus. On the death
of that bull, when they sought and found a calf of the same
colour,&mdash;that is, similarly marked with certain white spots,&mdash;they
believed it was something miraculous, and divinely provided
for them. Yet it was no great thing for the demons,
in order to deceive them, to show to a cow when she was
conceiving and pregnant the image of such a bull, which she
alone could see, and by it attract the breeding passion of the
mother, so that it might appear in a bodily shape in her
young, just as Jacob so managed with the spotted rods that
the sheep and goats were born spotted. For what men can
do with real colours and substances, the demons can very
easily do by showing unreal forms to breeding animals.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>Who were kings of Argos, and of Assyria, when Jacob died in Egypt.</i></p>

<p>Apis, then, who died in Egypt, was not the king of Egypt,
but of Argos. He was succeeded by his son Argus, from
whose name the land was called Argos and the people Argives,
for under the earlier kings neither the place nor the nation
as yet had this name. While he then reigned over Argos,
and Eratus over Sicyon, and Bal√¶us still remained king of
Assyria, Jacob died in Egypt a hundred and forty-seven years
old, after he had, when dying, blessed his sons and his grandsons
by Joseph, and prophesied most plainly of Christ, saying
in the blessing of Judah, "A prince shall not fail out of
Judah, nor a leader from his thighs, until those things come
which are laid up for him; and He is the expectation of the
nations."<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">[499]</a> In the reign of Argus Greece began to use fruits,
and to have crops of corn in cultivated fields, the seed having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
been brought from other countries. Argus also began to be
accounted a god after his death, and was honoured with a
temple and sacrifices. This honour was conferred in his reign,
before being given to him, on a private individual for being
the first to yoke oxen in the plough. This was one Homogyrus,
who was struck by lightning.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Who were kings when Joseph died in Egypt.</i></p>

<p>In the reign of Mamitus, the twelfth king of Assyria, and
Plemn√¶us, the eleventh of Sicyon, while Argus still reigned
over the Argives, Joseph died in Egypt a hundred and ten
years old. After his death, the people of God, increasing
wonderfully, remained in Egypt a hundred and forty-five
years, in tranquillity at first, until those who knew Joseph were
dead. Afterward, through envy of their increase, and the
suspicion that they would at length gain their freedom, they
were oppressed with persecutions and the labours of intolerable
servitude, amid which, however, they still grew, being
multiplied with God-given fertility. During this period the
same kingdoms continued in Assyria and Greece.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Who were kings when Moses was born, and what gods began to be worshipped
then.</i></p>

<p>When Saphrus reigned as the fourteenth king of Assyria,
and Orthopolis as the twelfth of Sicyon, and Criasus as the
fifth of Argos, Moses was born in Egypt, by whom the
people of God were liberated from the Egyptian slavery, in
which they behoved to be thus tried that they might desire
the help of their Creator. Some have thought that Prometheus
lived during the reign of the kings now named. He
is reported to have formed men out of clay, because he was
esteemed the best teacher of wisdom; yet it does not appear
what wise men there were in his days. His brother Atlas is
said to have been a great astrologer; and this gave occasion
for the fable that he held up the sky, although the vulgar
opinion about his holding up the sky appears rather to have
been suggested by a high mountain named after him. Indeed,
from those times many other fabulous things began to
be invented in Greece; yet, down to Cecrops king of Athens,
in whose reign that city received its name, and in whose reign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
God brought His people out of Egypt by Moses, only a few
dead heroes are reported to have been deified according to the
vain superstition of the Greeks. Among these were Melantomice,
the wife of king Criasus, and Phorbas their son, who
succeeded his father as sixth king of the Argives, and Iasus,
son of Triopas, their seventh king, and their ninth king,
Sthenelas, or Stheneleus, or Sthenelus,&mdash;for his name is given
differently by different authors. In those times also, Mercury,
the grandson of Atlas by his daughter Maia, is said to
have lived, according to the common report in books. He
was famous for his skill in many arts, and taught them to
men, for which they resolved to make him, and even believed
that he deserved to be, a god after death. Hercules is
said to have been later, yet belonging to the same period;
although some, whom I think mistaken, assign him an earlier
date than Mercury. But at whatever time they were born,
it is agreed among grave historians, who have committed these
ancient things to writing, that both were men, and that they
merited divine honours from mortals because they conferred
on them many benefits to make this life more pleasant to
them. Minerva was far more ancient than these; for she
is reported to have appeared in virgin age in the times of
Ogyges at the lake called Triton, from which she is also
styled Tritonia, the inventress truly of many works, and the
more readily believed to be a goddess because her origin was
so little known. For what is sung about her having sprung
from the head of Jupiter belongs to the region of poetry and
fable, and not to that of history and real fact. And historical
writers are not agreed when Ogyges flourished, in whose time
also a great flood occurred,&mdash;not that greatest one from which
no man escaped except those who could get into the ark, for
neither Greek nor Latin history knew of it, yet a greater
flood than that which happened afterward in Deucalion's
time. For Varro begins the book I have already mentioned
at this date, and does not propose to himself, as the starting-point
from which he may arrive at Roman affairs, anything
more ancient than the flood of Ogyges, that is, which happened
in the time of Ogyges. Now our writers of chronicles&mdash;first
Eusebius, and afterwards Jerome, who entirely follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
some earlier historians in this opinion&mdash;relate that the flood
of Ogyges happened more than three hundred years after,
during the reign of Phoroneus, the second king of Argos.
But whenever he may have lived, Minerva was already worshipped
as a goddess when Cecrops reigned in Athens, in
whose reign the city itself is reported to have been rebuilt
or founded.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>When the city of Athens was founded, and what reason Varro assigns for its
name.</i></p>

<p>Athens certainly derived its name from Minerva, who in
Greek is called &#7944;&#952;&#951;&#957;&#951;, and Varro points out the following
reason why it was so called. When an olive-tree suddenly
appeared there, and water burst forth in another place, these
prodigies moved the king to send to the Delphic Apollo to
inquire what they meant and what he should do. He answered
that the olive signified Minerva, the water Neptune,
and that the citizens had it in their power to name their
city as they chose, after either of these two gods whose signs
these were. On receiving this oracle, Cecrops convoked all
the citizens of either sex to give their vote, for it was then
the custom in those parts for the women also to take part in
public deliberations. When the multitude was consulted, the
men gave their votes for Neptune, the women for Minerva;
and as the women had a majority of one, Minerva conquered.
Then Neptune, being enraged, laid waste the lands of the
Athenians, by casting up the waves of the sea; for the
demons have no difficulty in scattering any waters more
widely. The same authority said, that to appease his wrath
the women should be visited by the Athenians with the threefold
punishment&mdash;that they should no longer have any vote;
that none of their children should be named after their
mothers; and that no one should call them Athenians. Thus
that city, the mother and nurse of liberal doctrines, and of
so many and so great philosophers, than whom Greece had
nothing more famous and noble, by the mockery of demons
about the strife of their gods, a male and female, and from
the victory of the female one through the women, received
the name of Athens; and, on being damaged by the vanquished
god, was compelled to punish the very victory of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
victress, fearing the waters of Neptune more than the arms
of Minerva. For in the women who were thus punished,
Minerva, who had conquered, was conquered too, and could
not even help her voters so far that, although the right of
voting was henceforth lost, and the mothers could not give
their names to the children, they might at least be allowed to
be called Athenians, and to merit the name of that goddess
whom they had made victorious over a male god by giving
her their votes. What and how much could be said about
this, if we had not to hasten to other things in our discourse,
is obvious.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>What Varro reports about the term Areopagus, and about Deucalion's
flood.</i></p>

<p>Marcus Varro, however, is not willing to credit lying fables
against the gods, lest he should find something dishonouring
to their majesty; and therefore he will not admit that the
Areopagus, the place where the Apostle Paul disputed with
the Athenians, got this name because Mars, who in Greek is
called &#7948;&#961;&#951;&#962;, when he was charged with the crime of homicide,
and was judged by twelve gods in that field, was acquitted
by the sentence of six; because it was the custom,
when the votes were equal, to acquit rather than condemn.
Against this opinion, which is much most widely published,
he tries, from the notices of obscure books, to support
another reason for this name, lest the Athenians should be
thought to have called it Areopagus from the words "Mars" and
"field,"<a name="FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">[500]</a> as if it were the field of Mars, to the dishonour of the
gods, forsooth, from whom he thinks lawsuits and judgments
far removed. And he asserts that this which is said about
Mars is not less false than what is said about the three
goddesses, to wit, Juno, Minerva, and Venus, whose contest
for the palm of beauty, before Paris as judge, in order to obtain
the golden apple, is not only related, but is celebrated in
songs and dances amid the applause of the theatres, in plays
meant to please the gods who take pleasure in these crimes of
their own, whether real or fabled. Varro does not believe
these things, because they are incompatible with the nature
of the gods and of morality; and yet, in giving not a fabulous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
but a historic reason for the name of Athens, he inserts in his
books the strife between Neptune and Minerva as to whose
name should be given to that city, which was so great that,
when they contended by the display of prodigies, even Apollo
dared not judge between them when consulted; but, in order to
end the strife of the gods, just as Jupiter sent the three goddesses
we have named to Paris, so he sent them to men, when
Minerva won by the vote, and yet was defeated by the punishment
of her own voters, for she was unable to confer the title
of Athenians on the women who were her friends, although she
could impose it on the men who were her opponents. In
these times, when Cranaos reigned at Athens as the successor
of Cecrops, as Varro writes, but, according to our Eusebius and
Jerome, while Cecrops himself still remained, the flood occurred
which is called Deucalion's, because it occurred chiefly
in those parts of the earth in which he reigned. But this
flood did not at all reach Egypt or its vicinity.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>When Moses led the people out of Egypt; and who were kings when his
successor Joshua the son of Nun died.</i></p>

<p>Moses led the people out of Egypt in the last time of
Cecrops king of Athens, when Ascatades reigned in Assyria,
Marathus in Sicyon, Triopas in Argos; and having led forth
the people, he gave them at Mount Sinai the law he received
from God, which is called the Old Testament, because it has
earthly promises, and because, through Jesus Christ, there
was to be a New Testament, in which the kingdom of heaven
should be promised. For the same order behoved to be
observed in this as is observed in each man who prospers
in God, according to the saying of the apostle, "That is not
first which is spiritual, but that which is natural," since, as
he says, and that truly, "The first man of the earth, is earthly;
the second man, from heaven, is heavenly."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id="FNanchor_501_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_501" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> Now Moses
ruled the people for forty years in the wilderness, and died a
hundred and twenty years old, after he had prophesied of
Christ by the types of carnal observances in the tabernacle,
priesthood, and sacrifices, and many other mystic ordinances.
Joshua the son of Nun succeeded Moses, and settled in the
land of promise the people he had brought in, having by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
divine authority conquered the people by whom it was
formerly possessed. He also died, after ruling the people
twenty-seven years after the death of Moses, when Amyntas
reigned in Assyria as the eighteenth king, Coracos as the sixteenth
in Sicyon, Danaos as the tenth in Argos, Ericthonius
as the fourth in Athens.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>12. <i>Of the rituals of false gods instituted by the kings of Greece in the period
from Israel's exodus from Egypt down to the death of Joshua the son
of Nun.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>During this period, that is, from Israel's exodus from Egypt
down to the death of Joshua the son of Nun, through whom
that people received the land of promise, rituals were instituted
to the false gods by the kings of Greece, which, by
stated celebration, recalled the memory of the flood, and of
men's deliverance from it, and of that troublous life they then
led in migrating to and fro between the heights and the
plains. For even the Luperci,<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> when they ascend and descend
the sacred path, are said to represent the men who sought
the mountain summits because of the inundation of water,
and returned to the lowlands on its subsidence. In those
times, Dionysus, who was also called Father Liber, and was
esteemed a god after death, is said to have shown the vine
to his host in Attica. Then the musical games were instituted
for the Delphic Apollo, to appease his anger, through
which they thought the regions of Greece were afflicted with
barrenness, because they had not defended his temple which
Danaos burnt when he invaded those lands; for they were
warned by his oracle to institute these games. But king
Ericthonius first instituted games to him in Attica, and not to
him only, but also to Minerva, in which games the olive was
given as the prize to the victors, because they relate that
Minerva was the discoverer of that fruit, as Liber was of the
grape. In those years Europa is alleged to have been carried
off by Xanthus king of Crete (to whom we find some
give another name), and to have borne him Rhadamanthus,
Sarpedon, and Minos, who are more commonly reported to
have been the sons of Jupiter by the same woman. Now
those who worship such gods regard what we have said about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
Xanthus king of Crete as true history; but this about
Jupiter, which the poets sing, the theatres applaud, and the
people celebrate, as empty fable got up as a reason for games
to appease the deities, even with the false ascription of crimes
to them. In those times Hercules was held in honour in
Tyre, but that was not the same one as he whom we spoke of
above. In the more secret history there are said to have been
several who were called Father Liber and Hercules. This
Hercules, whose great deeds are reckoned as twelve (not including
the slaughter of Ant√¶us the African, because that
affair pertains to another Hercules), is declared in their books
to have burned himself on Mount &#338;ta, because he was not
able, by that strength with which he had subdued monsters,
to endure the disease under which he languished. At that
time the king, or rather tyrant Busiris, who is alleged to have
been the son of Neptune by Libya the daughter of Epaphus,
is said to have offered up his guests in sacrifice to the gods.
Now it must not be believed that Neptune committed this
adultery, lest the gods should be criminated; yet such things
must be ascribed to them by the poets and in the theatres,
that they may be pleased with them. Vulcan and Minerva
are said to have been the parents of Ericthonius king of
Athens, in whose last years Joshua the son of Nun is found
to have died. But since they will have it that Minerva is
a virgin, they say that Vulcan, being disturbed in the struggle
between them, poured out his seed into the earth, and on that
account the man born of it received that name; for in the
Greek language &#7956;&#961;&#953;&#962; is "strife," and &#967;&#952;&#8060;&#957; "earth," of which two
words Ericthonius is a compound. Yet it must be admitted
that the more learned disprove and disown such things concerning
their gods, and declare that this fabulous belief originated
in the fact that in the temple at Athens, which Vulcan
and Minerva had in common, a boy who had been exposed
was found wrapped up in the coils of a dragon, which signified
that he would become great, and, as his parents were unknown,
he was called the son of Vulcan and Minerva, because
they had the temple in common. Yet that fable accounts for
the origin of his name better than this history. But what
does it matter to us? Let the one in books that speak the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
truth edify religious men, and the other in lying fables delight
impure demons. Yet these religious men worship them as
gods. Still, while they deny these things concerning them,
they cannot clear them of all crime, because at their demand
they exhibit plays in which the very things they wisely deny
are basely done, and the gods are appeased by these false and
base things. Now, even although the play celebrates an unreal
crime of the gods, yet to delight in the ascription of an unreal
crime is a real one.</p>

Hebrews.</i></p>

<p>After the death of Joshua the son of Nun, the people of
God had judges, in whose times they were alternately humbled
by afflictions on account of their sins, and consoled by prosperity
through the compassion of God. In those times were
invented the fables about Triptolemus, who, at the command
of Ceres, borne by winged snakes, bestowed corn on the needy
lands in flying over them; about that beast the Minotaur,
which was shut up in the Labyrinth, from which men who
entered its inextricable mazes could find no exit; about the
Centaurs, whose form was a compound of horse and man;
about Cerberus, the three-headed dog of hell; about Phryxus
and his sister Hellas, who fled, borne by a winged ram; about
the Gorgon, whose hair was composed of serpents, and who
turned those who looked on her into stone; about Bellerophon,
who was carried by a winged horse called Pegasus;
about Amphion, who charmed and attracted the stones by the
sweetness of his harp; about the artificer D√¶dalus and his
son Icarus, who flew on wings they had fitted on; about
&#338;dipus, who compelled a certain four-footed monster with a
human face, called a sphynx, to destroy herself by casting
herself headlong, having solved the riddle she was wont to
propose as insoluble; about Ant√¶us, who was the son of the
earth, for which reason, on falling on the earth, he was wont
to rise up stronger, whom Hercules slew; and perhaps there
are others which I have forgotten. These fables, easily found
in histories containing a true account of events, bring us down
to the Trojan war, at which Marcus Varro has closed his
second book about the race of the Roman people; and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
are so skilfully invented by men as to involve no scandal to
the gods. But whoever have pretended as to Jupiter's rape
of Ganymede, a very beautiful boy, that king Tantalus committed
the crime, and the fable ascribed it to Jupiter; or as
to his impregnating Dan√§e as a golden shower, that it means
that the woman's virtue was corrupted by gold: whether these
things were really done or only fabled in those days, or were
really done by others and falsely ascribed to Jupiter, it is
impossible to tell how much wickedness must have been taken
for granted in men's hearts that they should be thought able
to listen to such lies with patience. And yet they willingly
accepted them, when, indeed, the more devotedly they worshipped
Jupiter, they ought the more severely to have
punished those who durst say such things of him. But they
not only were not angry at those who invented these things,
but were afraid that the gods would be angry at them if they
did not act such fictions even in the theatres. In those times
Latona bore Apollo, not him of whose oracle we have spoken
above as so often consulted, but him who is said, along with
Hercules, to have fed the flocks of king Admetus; yet he was
so believed to be a god, that very many, indeed almost all, have
believed him to be the selfsame Apollo. Then also Father
Liber made war in India, and led in his army many women
called Bacch√¶, who were notable not so much for valour as for
fury. Some, indeed, write that this Liber was both conquered
and bound; and some that he was slain in Persia, even telling
where he was buried; and yet in his name, as that of a god,
the unclean demons have instituted the sacred, or rather the
sacrilegious, Bacchanalia, of the outrageous vileness of which
the senate, after many years, became so much ashamed as to
prohibit them in the city of Rome. Men believed that in
those times Perseus and his wife Andromeda were raised into
heaven after their death, so that they were not ashamed or
afraid to mark out their images by constellations, and call
them by their names.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the theological poets.</i></p>

<p>During the same period of time arose the poets, who were
also called <i>theologues</i>, because they made hymns about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
gods; yet about such gods as, although great men, were yet
but men, or the elements of this world which the true God
made, or creatures who were ordained as principalities and
powers according to the will of the Creator and their own
merit. And if, among much that was vain and false, they
sang anything of the one true God, yet, by worshipping Him
along with others who are not gods, and showing them the
service that is due to Him alone, they did not serve Him at
all rightly; and even such poets as Orpheus, Mus√¶us, and
Linus, were unable to abstain from dishonouring their gods by
fables. But yet these theologues worshipped the gods, and
were not worshipped as gods, although the city of the ungodly
is wont, I know not how, to set Orpheus over the sacred, or
rather sacrilegious, rites of hell. The wife of king Athamas,
who was called Ino, and her son Melicertes, perished by
throwing themselves into the sea, and were, according to popular
belief, reckoned among the gods, like other men of the same
times, [among whom were] Castor and Pollux. The Greeks,
indeed, called her who was the mother of Melicertes, Leucothea,
the Latins Matuta; but both thought her a goddess.</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Of the fall of the kingdom of Argos, when Picus the son of Saturn first
received his father's kingdom of Laurentum.</i></p>

<p>During those times the kingdom of Argos came to an end,
being transferred to Mycene, from which Agamemnon came,
and the kingdom of Laurentum arose, of which Picus son of
Saturn was the first king, when the woman Deborah judged
the Hebrews; but it was the Spirit of God who used her as
His agent, for she was also a prophetess, although her prophecy
is so obscure that we could not demonstrate, without a
long discussion, that it was uttered concerning Christ. Now
the Laurentes already reigned in Italy, from whom the origin
of the Roman people is quite evidently derived after the
Greeks; yet the kingdom of Assyria still lasted, in which
Lampares was the twenty-third king when Picus first began
to reign at Laurentum. The worshippers of such gods may
see what they are to think of Saturn the father of Picus, who
deny that he was a man; of whom some also have written
that he himself reigned in Italy before Picus his son; and
Virgil in his well-known book says,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"That race indocile, and through mountains high<br /></span>

</div></div></div>

<p>But they regard these as poetic fancies, and assert that the
father of Picus was Sterces rather, and relate that, being a
most skilful husbandman, he discovered that the fields could
be fertilized by the dung of animals, which is called <i>stercus</i>
from his name. Some say he was called Stercutius. But
for whatever reason they chose to call him Saturn, it is
yet certain they made this Sterces or Stercutius a god for
his merit in agriculture; and they likewise received into the
number of these gods Picus his son, whom they affirm to
have been a famous augur and warrior. Picus begot Faunus,
the second king of Laurentum; and he too is, or was, a god
with them. These divine honours they gave to dead men
before the Trojan war.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>16. <i>Of Diomede, who after the destruction of Troy was placed among the gods,
while his companions are said to have been changed into birds.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Troy was overthrown, and its destruction was everywhere
sung and made well known even to boys; for it was signally
published and spread abroad, both by its own greatness and
by writers of excellent style. And this was done in the
reign of Latinus the son of Faunus, from whom the kingdom
began to be called Latium instead of Laurentum. The victorious
Greeks, on leaving Troy destroyed and returning to
their own countries, were torn and crushed by divers and
horrible calamities. Yet even from among them they increased
the number of their gods, for they made Diomede a
god. They allege that his return home was prevented by a
divinely imposed punishment, and they prove, not by fabulous
and poetic falsehood, but by historic attestation, that his companions
were turned into birds. Yet they think that, even
although he was made a god, he could neither restore them
to the human form by his own power, nor yet obtain it from
Jupiter his king, as a favour granted to a new inhabitant of
heaven. They also say that his temple is in the island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
Diomed√¶a, not far from Mount Garganus in Apulia, and that
these birds fly round about this temple, and worship in it
with such wonderful obedience, that they fill their beaks with
water and sprinkle it; and if Greeks, or those born of the
Greek race, come there, they are not only still, but fly to meet
them; but if they are foreigners, they fly up at their heads,
and wound them with such severe strokes as even to kill
them. For they are said to be well enough armed for these
combats with their hard and large beaks.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>What Varro says of the incredible transformations of men.</i></p>

<p>In support of this story, Varro relates others no less incredible
about that most famous sorceress Circe, who changed
the companions of Ulysses into beasts, and about the Arcadians,
who, by lot, swam across a certain pool, and were turned into
wolves there, and lived in the deserts of that region with
wild beasts like themselves. But if they never fed on human
flesh for nine years, they were restored to the human form
on swimming back again through the same pool. Finally, he
expressly names one Dem√¶netus, who, on tasting a boy offered
up in sacrifice by the Arcadians to their god Lyc√¶us according
to their custom, was changed into a wolf, and, being restored
to his proper form in the tenth year, trained himself as a
pugilist, and was victorious at the Olympic games. And the
same historian thinks that the epithet Lyc√¶us was applied
in Arcadia to Pan and Jupiter for no other reason than this
metamorphosis of men into wolves, because it was thought it
could not be wrought except by a divine power. For a wolf
is called in Greek &#955;&#965;&#954;&#8056;&#962;, from which the name Lyc√¶us appears
to be formed. He says also that the Roman Luperci
were as it were sprung of the seed of these mysteries.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>What we should believe concerning the transformations which seem to
happen to men through the art of demons.</i></p>

<p>Perhaps our readers expect us to say something about this
so great delusion wrought by the demons; and what shall we
say but that men must fly out of the midst of Babylon?<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> For
this prophetic precept is to be understood spiritually in this
sense, that by going forward in the living God, by the steps of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
faith, which worketh by love, we must flee out of the city of
this world, which is altogether a society of ungodly angels and
men. Yea, the greater we see the power of the demons to be
in these depths, so much the more tenaciously must we cleave
to the Mediator through whom we ascend from these lowest
to the highest places. For if we should say these things are
not to be credited, there are not wanting even now some
who would affirm that they had either heard on the best
authority, or even themselves experienced, something of that
kind. Indeed we ourselves, when in Italy, heard such things
about a certain region there, where landladies of inns, imbued
with these wicked arts, were said to be in the habit of giving
to such travellers as they chose, or could manage, something
in a piece of cheese by which they were changed on the spot
into beasts of burden, and carried whatever was necessary,
and were restored to their own form when the work was
done. Yet their mind did not become bestial, but remained
rational and human, just as Apuleius, in the books he wrote
with the title of <i>The Golden Ass</i>, has told, or feigned, that it
happened to his own self that, on taking poison, he became
an ass, while retaining his human mind.</p>

<p>These things are either false, or so extraordinary as to be
with good reason disbelieved. But it is to be most firmly
believed that Almighty God can do whatever He pleases,
whether in punishing or favouring, and that the demons can
accomplish nothing by their natural power (for their created
being is itself angelic, although made malign by their own
fault), except what He may permit, whose judgments are often
hidden, but never unrighteous. And indeed the demons, if
they really do such things as these on which this discussion
turns, do not create real substances, but only change the
appearance of things created by the true God so as to make
them seem to be what they are not. I cannot therefore
believe that even the body, much less the mind, can really be
changed into bestial forms and lineaments by any reason, art,
or power of the demons; but the phantasm of a man, which
even in thought or dreams goes through innumerable changes,
may, when the man's senses are laid asleep or overpowered,
be presented to the senses of others in a corporeal form, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
some indescribable way unknown to me, so that men's bodies
themselves may lie somewhere, alive, indeed, yet with their
senses locked up much more heavily and firmly than by
sleep, while that phantasm, as it were embodied in the shape
of some animal, may appear to the senses of others, and may
even seem to the man himself to be changed, just as he may
seem to himself in sleep to be so changed, and to bear burdens;
and these burdens, if they are real substances, are borne by
the demons, that men may be deceived by beholding at the
same time the real substance of the burdens and the simulated
bodies of the beasts of burden. For a certain man called
Pr√¶stantius used to tell that it had happened to his father in
his own house, that he took that poison in a piece of cheese,
and lay in his bed as if sleeping, yet could by no means be
aroused. But he said that after a few days he as it were
woke up and related the things he had suffered as if they
had been dreams, namely, that he had been made a sumpter
horse, and, along with other beasts of burden, had carried
provisions for the soldiers of what is called the Rh&#339;tian
Legion, because it was sent to Rh&#339;tia. And all this was
found to have taken place just as he told, yet it had seemed
to him to be his own dream. And another man declared
that in his own house at night, before he slept, he saw a
certain philosopher, whom he knew very well, come to him
and explain to him some things in the Platonic philosophy
which he had previously declined to explain when asked.
And when he had asked this philosopher why he did in his
house what he had refused to do at home, he said, "I did not
do it, but I dreamed I had done it." And thus what the
one saw when sleeping was shown to the other when awake
by a phantasmal image.</p>

<p>These things have not come to us from persons we might
deem unworthy of credit, but from informants we could not
suppose to be deceiving us. Therefore what men say and
have committed to writing about the Arcadians being often
changed into wolves by the Arcadian gods, or demons rather,
and what is told in song about Circe transforming the companions
of Ulysses,<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> if they were really done, may, in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
opinion, have been done in the way I have said. As for
Diomede's birds, since their race is alleged to have been perpetuated
by constant propagation, I believe they were not
made through the metamorphosis of men, but were slyly
substituted for them on their removal, just as the hind was
for Iphigenia, the daughter of king Agamemnon. For juggleries
of this kind could not be difficult for the demons if
permitted by the judgment of God; and since that virgin
was afterward found alive, it is easy to see that a hind had
been slyly substituted for her. But because the companions
of Diomede were of a sudden nowhere to be seen, and afterward
could nowhere be found, being destroyed by bad avenging
angels, they were believed to have been changed into
those birds, which were secretly brought there from other
places where such birds were, and suddenly substituted for
them by fraud. But that they bring water in their beaks
and sprinkle it on the temple of Diomede, and that they
fawn on men of Greek race and persecute aliens, is no wonderful
thing to be done by the inward influence of the demons,
whose interest it is to persuade men that Diomede was made
a god, and thus to beguile them into worshipping many false
gods, to the great dishonour of the true God; and to serve
dead men, who even in their lifetime did not truly live,
with temples, altars, sacrifices, and priests, all which, when
of the right kind, are due only to the one living and true
God.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>That √Üneas came into Italy when Abdon the judge ruled over the Hebrews.</i></p>

<p>After the capture and destruction of Troy, √Üneas, with
twenty ships laden with the Trojan relics, came into Italy,
when Latinus reigned there, Menestheus in Athens, Polyphidos
in Sicyon, and Tautanos in Assyria, and Abdon was
judge of the Hebrews. On the death of Latinus, √Üneas
reigned three years, the same kings continuing in the above-named
places, except that Pelasgus was now king in Sicyon,
and Sampson was judge of the Hebrews, who is thought to be
Hercules, because of his wonderful strength. Now the Latins
made √Üneas one of their gods, because at his death he was
nowhere to be found. The Sabines also placed among the
gods their first king, Sancus, [Sangus], or Sanctus, as some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
call him. At that time Codrus king of Athens exposed
himself <i>incognito</i> to be slain by the Peloponnesian foes of
that city, and so was slain. In this way, they say, he delivered
his country. For the Peloponnesians had received a
response from the oracle, that they should overcome the
Athenians only on condition that they did not slay their
king. Therefore he deceived them by appearing in a poor
man's dress, and provoking them, by quarrelling, to murder
him. Whence Virgil says, "Or the quarrels of Codrus."<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id="FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class="fnanchor">[506]</a>
And the Athenians worshipped this man as a god with
sacrificial honours. The fourth king of the Latins was
Silvius the son of √Üneas, not by Cre√ºsa, of whom Ascanius
the third king was born, but by Lavinia the daughter of
Latinus, and he is said to have been his posthumous child.
Oneus was the twenty-ninth king of Assyria, Melanthus the
sixteenth of the Athenians, and Eli the priest was judge of the
Hebrews; and the kingdom of Sicyon then came to an end,
after lasting, it is said, for nine hundred and fifty-nine years.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>Of the succession of the line of kings among the Israelites after the times
of the judges.</i></p>

<p>While these kings reigned in the places mentioned, the
period of the judges being ended, the kingdom of Israel next
began with king Saul, when Samuel the prophet lived. At
that date those Latin kings began who were surnamed Silvii,
having that surname, in addition to their proper name, from
their predecessor, that son of √Üneas who was called Silvius;
just as, long afterward, the successors of C√¶sar Augustus
were surnamed C√¶sars. Saul being rejected, so that none
of his issue should reign, on his death David succeeded him
in the kingdom, after he had reigned forty years. Then the
Athenians ceased to have kings after the death of Codrus,
and began to have a magistracy to rule the republic. After
David, who also reigned forty years, his son Solomon was
king of Israel, who built that most noble temple of God at
Jerusalem. In his time Alba was built among the Latins,
from which thereafter the kings began to be styled kings
not of the Latins, but of the Albans, although in the same
Latium. Solomon was succeeded by his son Rehoboam,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
under whom that people was divided into two kingdoms, and
its separate parts began to have separate kings.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the kings of Latium, the first and twelfth of whom, √Üneas and
Aventinus, were made gods.</i></p>

<p>After √Üneas, whom they deified, Latium had eleven kings,
none of whom was deified. But Aventinus, who was the
twelfth after √Üneas, having been laid low in war, and buried
in that hill still called by his name, was added to the number
of such gods as they made for themselves. Some, indeed,
were unwilling to write that he was slain in battle, but said
he was nowhere to be found, and that it was not from his
name, but from the alighting of birds, that hill was called
Aventinus.<a name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> After this no god was made in Latium except
Romulus the founder of Rome. But two kings are found
between these two, the first of whom I shall describe in the
Virgilian verse:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Next came that Procas, glory of the Trojan race."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">[508]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>That greatest of all kingdoms, the Assyrian, had its long
duration brought to a close in his time, the time of Rome's
birth drawing nigh. For the Assyrian empire was transferred
to the Medes after nearly thirteen hundred and five
years, if we include the reign of Belus, who begot Ninus,
and, content with a small kingdom, was the first king there.
Now Procas reigned before Amulius. And Amulius had
made his brother Numitor's daughter, Rhea by name, who
was also called Ilia, a vestal virgin, who conceived twin
sons by Mars, as they will have it, in that way honouring
or excusing her adultery, adding as a proof that a she-wolf
nursed the infants when exposed. For they think this kind
of beast belongs to Mars, so that the she-wolf is believed to
have given her teats to the infants, because she knew they
were the sons of Mars her lord; although there are not wanting
persons who say that when the crying babes lay exposed,
they were first of all picked up by I know not what harlot,
and sucked her breasts first (now harlots were called <i>lup√¶</i>, she-wolves,
from which their vile abodes are even yet called <i>lupanaria</i>),
and that afterwards they came into the hands of the
shepherd Faustulus, and were nursed by Acca his wife. Yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
what wonder is it, if, to rebuke the king who had cruelly
ordered them to be thrown into the water, God was pleased, after
divinely delivering them from the water, to succour, by means
of a wild beast giving milk, these infants by whom so great a
city was to be founded? Amulius was succeeded in the Latian
kingdom by his brother Numitor, the grandfather of Romulus;
and Rome was founded in the first year of this Numitor, who
from that time reigned along with his grandson Romulus.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>That Rome was founded when the Assyrian kingdom perished, at which
time Hezekiah reigned in Judah.</i></p>

<p>To be brief, the city of Rome was founded, like another
Babylon, and as it were the daughter of the former Babylon,
by which God was pleased to conquer the whole world, and
subdue it far and wide by bringing it into one fellowship of
government and laws. For there were already powerful and
brave peoples and nations trained to arms, who did not easily
yield, and whose subjugation necessarily involved great danger
and destruction as well as great and horrible labour. For
when the Assyrian kingdom subdued almost all Asia, although
this was done by fighting, yet the wars could not be very
fierce or difficult, because the nations were as yet untrained to
resist, and neither so many nor so great as afterward; forasmuch
as, after that greatest and indeed universal flood, when
only eight men escaped in Noah's ark, not much more than a
thousand years had passed when Ninus subdued all Asia with
the exception of India. But Rome did not with the same
quickness and facility wholly subdue all those nations of the
east and west which we see brought under the Roman empire,
because, in its gradual increase, in whatever direction it was extended,
it found them strong and warlike. At the time when
Rome was founded, then, the people of Israel had been in the
land of promise seven hundred and eighteen years. Of these
years twenty-seven belong to Joshua the son of Nun, and
after that three hundred and twenty-nine to the period of the
judges. But from the time when the kings began to reign
there, three hundred and sixty-two years had passed. And
at that time there was a king in Judah called Ahaz, or,
as others compute, Hezekiah his successor, the best and
most pious king, who it is admitted reigned in the times of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
Romulus. And in that part of the Hebrew nation called
Israel, Hoshea had begun to reign.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Of the Erythr√¶an sibyl, who is known to have sung many things about
Christ more plainly than the other sibyls.</i></p>

<p>Some say the Erythr√¶an sibyl prophesied at this time.
Now Varro declares there were many sibyls, and not merely
one. This sibyl of Erythr√¶ certainly wrote some things
concerning Christ which are quite manifest, and we first read
them in the Latin tongue in verses of bad Latin, and unrhythmical,
through the unskilfulness, as we afterward learned, of
some interpreter unknown to me. For Flaccianus, a very
famous man, who was also a proconsul, a man of most ready
eloquence and much learning, when we were speaking about
Christ, produced a Greek manuscript, saying that it was the
prophecies of the Erythr√¶an sibyl, in which he pointed out a
certain passage which had the initial letters of the lines so
arranged that these words could be read in them: &#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962;
&#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#963;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#961;, which mean, "Jesus Christ the Son
of God, the Saviour." And these verses, of which the initial
letters yield that meaning, contain what follows as translated
by some one into Latin in good rhythm:</p>

<p>In these Latin verses the meaning of the Greek is correctly
given, although not in the exact order of the lines as connected
with the initial letters; for in three of them, the fifth,
eighteenth, and nineteenth, where the Greek letter &#933; occurs,
Latin words could not be found beginning with the corresponding
letter, and yielding a suitable meaning. So that, if
we note down together the initial letters of all the lines in
our Latin translation except those three in which we retain
the letter &#933; in the proper place, they will express in five
Greek words this meaning, "Jesus Christ the Son of God, the
Saviour." And the verses are twenty-seven, which is the cube
of three. For three times three are nine; and nine itself, if
tripled, so as to rise from the superficial square to the cube,
comes to twenty-seven. But if you join the initial letters of
these five Greek words, &#7992;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166;&#962; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#8056;&#962; &#920;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#963;&#969;&#964;&#8053;&#961;,
which mean, "Jesus Christ the Son of God, the Saviour," they
will make the word &#7984;&#967;&#952;&#8058;&#962;, that is, "fish," in which word Christ
is mystically understood, because He was able to live, that is,
to exist, without sin in the abyss of this mortality as in the
depth of waters.</p>

<p>But this sibyl, whether she is the Erythr√¶an, or, as some
rather believe, the Cum√¶an, in her whole poem, of which this
is a very small portion, not only has nothing that can relate
to the worship of the false or feigned gods, but rather speaks
against them and their worshippers in such a way that we
might even think she ought to be reckoned among those who
belong to the city of God. Lactantius also inserted in his
work the prophecies about Christ of a certain sibyl, he does
not say which. But I have thought fit to combine in a single
extract, which may seem long, what he has set down in many
short quotations. She says, "Afterward He shall come into
the injurious hands of the unbelieving, and they will give
God buffets with profane hands, and with impure mouth will
spit out envenomed spittle; but He will with simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
yield His holy back to stripes. And He will hold His peace
when struck with the fist, that no one may find out what
word, or whence, He comes to speak to hell; and He shall be
crowned with a crown of thorns. And they gave Him gall
for meat, and vinegar for His thirst: they will spread this
table of inhospitality. For thou thyself, being foolish, hast not
understood thy God, deluding the minds of mortals, but hast
both crowned Him with thorns and mingled for Him bitter
gall. But the veil of the temple shall be rent; and at midday
it shall be darker than night for three hours. And He shall
die the death, taking sleep for three days; and then returning
from hell, He first shall come to the light, the beginning of
the resurrection being shown to the recalled." Lactantius
made use of these sibylline testimonies, introducing them bit
by bit in the course of his discussion as the things he intended
to prove seemed to require, and we have set them down in one
connected series, uninterrupted by comment, only taking care
to mark them by capitals, if only the transcribers do not neglect
to preserve them hereafter. Some writers, indeed, say that the
Erythr√¶an sibyl was not in the time of Romulus, but of the
Trojan war.</p>

<p>24. <i>That the seven sages flourished in the reign of Romulus, when the ten tribes
which were called Israel were led into captivity by the Chaldeans, and
Romulus, when dead, had divine honours conferred on him.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>While Romulus reigned, Thales the Milesian is said to have
lived, being one of the seven sages, who succeeded the theological
poets, of whom Orpheus was the most renowned, and
were called &#931;&#959;&#966;&#959;&#8055;, that is, sages. During that time the ten
tribes, which on the division of the people were called Israel,
were conquered by the Chaldeans and led captive into their
lands, while the two tribes which were called Judah, and had
the seat of their kingdom in Jerusalem, remained in the land
of Judea. As Romulus, when dead, could nowhere be found,
the Romans, as is everywhere notorious, placed him among
the gods,&mdash;a thing which by that time had already ceased to
be done, and which was not done afterwards till the time of the
C√¶sars, and then not through error, but in flattery; so that
Cicero ascribes great praises to Romulus, because he merited
such honours not in rude and unlearned times, when men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
were easily deceived, but in times already polished and learned,
although the subtle and acute loquacity of the philosophers
had not yet culminated. But although the later times did
not deify dead men, still they did not cease to hold and worship
as gods those deified of old; nay, by images, which the
ancients never had, they even increased the allurements of
vain and impious superstition, the unclean demons effecting
this in their heart, and also deceiving them by lying oracles,
so that even the fabulous crimes of the gods, which were not
once imagined by a more polite age, were yet basely acted in
the plays in honour of these same false deities. Numa reigned
after Romulus; and although he had thought that Rome would
be better defended the more gods there were, yet on his death
he himself was not counted worthy of a place among them, as
if it were supposed that he had so crowded heaven that a place
could not be found for him there. They report that the Samian
sibyl lived while he reigned at Rome, and when Manasseh
began to reign over the Hebrews,&mdash;an impious king, by whom
the prophet Isaiah is said to have been slain.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>25. <i>What philosophers were famous when Tarquinius Priscus reigned over the
Romans, and Zedekiah over the Hebrews, when Jerusalem was taken and
the temple overthrown.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>When Zedekiah reigned over the Hebrews, and Tarquinius
Priscus, the successor of Ancus Martius, over the Romans, the
Jewish people was led captive into Babylon, Jerusalem and
the temple built by Solomon being overthrown. For the prophets,
in chiding them for their iniquity and impiety, predicted
that these things should come to pass, especially Jeremiah,
who even stated the number of years. Pittacus of Mitylene,
another of the sages, is reported to have lived at that time.
And Eusebius writes that, while the people of God were held
captive in Babylon, the five other sages lived, who must be
added to Thales, whom we mentioned above, and Pittacus, in
order to make up the seven. These are Solon of Athens, Chilo
of Laced√¶mon, Periander of Corinth, Cleobulus of Lindus, and
Bias of Priene. These flourished after the theological poets, and
were called sages, because they excelled other men in a certain
laudable line of life, and summed up some moral precepts
in epigrammatic sayings. But they left posterity no literary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
monuments, except that Solon is alleged to have given certain
laws to the Athenians, and Thales was a natural philosopher,
and left books of his doctrine in short proverbs. In that time
of the Jewish captivity, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and Xenophanes,
the natural philosophers, flourished. Pythagoras also
lived then, and at this time the name philosopher was first used.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>26. <i>That at the time when the captivity of the Jews was brought to an end, on the
completion of seventy years, the Romans also were freed from kingly rule.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>At this time, Cyrus king of Persia, who also ruled the Chaldeans
and Assyrians, having somewhat relaxed the captivity
of the Jews, made fifty thousand of them return in order to
rebuild the temple. They only began the first foundations
and built the altar; but, owing to hostile invasions, they were
unable to go on, and the work was put off to the time of Darius.
During the same time also those things were done which are
written in the book of Judith, which, indeed, the Jews are
said not to have received into the canon of the Scriptures.
Under Darius king of Persia, then, on the completion of the
seventy years predicted by Jeremiah the prophet, the captivity
of the Jews was brought to an end, and they were restored
to liberty. Tarquin then reigned as the seventh king of the
Romans. On his expulsion, they also began to be free from
the rule of their kings. Down to this time the people of
Israel had prophets; but, although they were numerous, the
canonical writings of only a few of them have been preserved
among the Jews and among us. In closing the previous book,
I promised to set down something in this one about them, and
I shall now do so.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>27. <i>Of the times of the prophets whose oracles are contained in books, and who
sang many things about the call of the Gentiles at the time when the Roman
kingdom began and the Assyrian came to an end.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>In order that we may be able to consider these times, let us
go back a little to earlier times. At the beginning of the book
of the prophet Hosea, who is placed first of twelve, it is written,
"The word of the Lord which came to Hosea in the days of
Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id="FNanchor_509_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_509" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> Amos
also writes that he prophesied in the days of Uzziah, and adds
the name of Jeroboam king of Israel, who lived at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
time.<a name="FNanchor_510_510" id="FNanchor_510_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_510" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> Isaiah the son of Amos&mdash;either the above-named prophet,
or, as is rather affirmed, another who was not a prophet, but
was called by the same name&mdash;also puts at the head of his book
these four kings named by Hosea, saying by way of preface
that he prophesied in their days.<a name="FNanchor_511_511" id="FNanchor_511_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_511" class="fnanchor">[511]</a> Micah also names the same
times as those of his prophecy, after the days of Uzziah;<a name="FNanchor_512_512" id="FNanchor_512_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_512" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> for
he names the same three kings as Hosea named,&mdash;Jotham,
Ahaz, and Hezekiah. We find from their own writings that
these men prophesied contemporaneously. To these are added
Jonah in the reign of Uzziah, and Joel in that of Jotham, who
succeeded Uzziah. But we can find the date of these two
prophets in the chronicles,<a name="FNanchor_513_513" id="FNanchor_513_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_513" class="fnanchor">[513]</a> not in their own writings, for they
say nothing about it themselves. Now these days extend from
Procas king of the Latins, or his predecessor Aventinus, down
to Romulus king of the Romans, or even to the beginning of
the reign of his successor, Numa Pompilius. Hezekiah king
of Judah certainly reigned till then. So that thus these fountains
of prophecy, as I may call them, burst forth at once during
those times when the Assyrian kingdom failed and the Roman
began; so that, just as in the first period of the Assyrian kingdom
Abraham arose, to whom the most distinct promises were
made that all nations should be blessed in his seed, so at the
beginning of the western Babylon, in the time of whose government
Christ was to come in whom these promises were to be
fulfilled, the oracles of the prophets were given not only in
spoken but in written words, for a testimony that so great a
thing should come to pass. For although the people of Israel
hardly ever lacked prophets from the time when they began to
have kings, these were only for their own use, not for that of
the nations. But when the more manifestly prophetic Scripture
began to be formed, which was to benefit the nations
too, it was fitting that it should begin when this city was
founded which was to rule the nations.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>Of the things pertaining to the gospel of Christ which Hosea and Amos
prophesied.</i></p>

<p>The prophet Hosea speaks so very profoundly that it is
laborious work to penetrate his meaning. But, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
promise, we must insert something from his book. He says,
"And it shall come to pass that in the place where it was
said unto them, Ye are not my people, there they shall be
called the sons of the living God."<a name="FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> Even the apostles understood
this as a prophetic testimony of the calling of the nations
who did not formerly belong to God; and because this same
people of the Gentiles is itself spiritually among the children
of Abraham, and for that reason is rightly called Israel, therefore
he goes on to say, "And the children of Judah and the
children of Israel shall be gathered together in one, and shall
appoint themselves one headship, and shall ascend from the
earth."<a name="FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> We should but weaken the savour of this prophetic
oracle if we set ourselves to expound it. Let the reader but
call to mind that corner-stone and those two walls of partition,
the one of the Jews, the other of the Gentiles,<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id="FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> and he will recognise
them, the one under the term sons of Judah, the other
as sons of Israel, supporting themselves by one and the same
headship, and ascending from the earth. But that those carnal
Israelites who are now unwilling to believe in Christ shall
afterward believe, that is, their children shall (for they themselves,
of course, shall go to their own place by dying), this
same prophet testifies, saying, "For the children of Israel shall
abide many days without a king, without a prince, without a
sacrifice, without an altar, without a priesthood, without manifestations."<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">[517]</a>
Who does not see that the Jews are now thus?
But let us hear what he adds: "And afterward shall the children
of Israel return, and seek the Lord their God, and David
their king, and shall be amazed at the Lord and at His goodness
in the latter days."<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">[518]</a> Nothing is clearer than this prophecy,
in which by David, as distinguished by the title of king,
Christ is to be understood, "who is made," as the apostle says,
"of the seed of David according to the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id="FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> This prophet
has also foretold the resurrection of Christ on the third day,
as it behoved to be foretold, with prophetic loftiness, when he
says, "He will heal us after two days, and in the third day we
shall rise again."<a name="FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> In agreement with this the apostle says
to us, "If ye be risen with Christ, seek those things which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
above."<a name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> Amos also prophesies thus concerning such things:
"Prepare thee, that thou mayst invoke thy God, O Israel; for
lo, I am binding the thunder, and creating the spirit, and announcing
to men their Christ."<a name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> And in another place he
says, "In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that
is fallen, and build up the breaches thereof; and I will raise
up his ruins, and will build them up again as in the days of
old: that the residue of men may inquire for me, and all the
nations upon whom my name is invoked, saith the Lord that
doeth this."<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">[523]</a></p>


<p class="center">29. <i>What things are predicted by Isaiah concerning Christ and the Church.</i></p>

<p>The prophecy of Isaiah is not in the book of the twelve
prophets, who are called the minor from the brevity of their
writings, as compared with those who are called the greater
prophets because they published larger volumes. Isaiah belongs
to the latter, yet I connect him with the two above
named, because he prophesied at the same time. Isaiah, then,
together with his rebukes of wickedness, precepts of righteousness,
and predictions of evil, also prophesied much more than
the rest about Christ and the Church, that is, about the King
and that city which he founded; so that some say he should
be called an evangelist rather than a prophet. But, in order
to finish this work, I quote only one out of many in this
place. Speaking in the person of the Father, he says, "Behold,
my servant shall understand, and shall be exalted and glorified
very much. As many shall be astonished at Thee."<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id="FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> This is
about Christ.</p>

<p>But let us now hear what follows about the Church. He
says, "Rejoice, O barren, thou that barest not; break forth
and cry, thou that didst not travail with child: for many more
are the children of the desolate than of her that has an husband."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">[525]</a>
But these must suffice; and some things in them
ought to be expounded; yet I think those parts sufficient which
are so plain that even enemies must be compelled against their
will to understand them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">30. <i>What Micah, Jonah, and Joel prophesied in accordance with the New
Testament.</i></p>

<p>The prophet Micah, representing Christ under the figure of
a great mountain, speaks thus: "It shall come to pass in the
last days, that the manifested mountain of the Lord shall be
prepared on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted
above the hills; and people shall hasten unto it. Many nations
shall go, and shall say, Come, let us go up into the mountain of
the Lord, and into the house of the God of Jacob; and He
will show us His way, and we will go in His paths: for out
of Zion shall proceed the law, and the word of the Lord out
of Jerusalem. And He shall judge among many people, and
rebuke strong nations afar off."<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id="FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> This prophet predicts the
very place in which Christ was born, saying, "And thou,
Bethlehem, of the house of Ephratah, art the least that can
be reckoned among the thousands of Judah; out of thee shall
come forth unto me a leader, to be the prince in Israel; and His
going forth is from the beginning, even from the days of eternity.
Therefore will He give them [up] even until the time
when she that travaileth shall bring forth; and the remnant
of His brethren shall be converted to the sons of Israel. And
He shall stand, and see, and feed His flock in the strength of
the Lord, and in the dignity of the name of the Lord His
God: for now shall He be magnified even to the utmost of
the earth."<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id="FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<p>The prophet Jonah, not so much by speech as by his own
painful experience, prophesied Christ's death and resurrection
much more clearly than if he had proclaimed them with his
voice. For why was he taken into the whale's belly and restored
on the third day, but that he might be a sign that
Christ should return from the depths of hell on the third
day?</p>

<p>I should be obliged to use many words in explaining all
that Joel prophesies in order to make clear those that pertain
to Christ and the Church. But there is one passage I must
not pass by, which the apostles also quoted when the Holy
Spirit came down from above on the assembled believers according
to Christ's promise. He says, "And it shall come to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
pass after these things, that I will pour out my Spirit upon
all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
and your old men shall dream, and your young men shall see
visions: and even on my servants and mine handmaids in
those days will I pour out my Spirit."<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id="FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class="fnanchor">[528]</a></p>


<p class="center">31. <i>Of the predictions concerning the salvation of the world in Christ, in
Obadiah, Nahum, and Habakkuk.</i></p>

<p>The date of three of the minor prophets, Obadiah, Nahum,
and Habakkuk, is neither mentioned by themselves nor given
in the chronicles of Eusebius and Jerome. For although
they put Obadiah with Micah, yet when Micah prophesied
does not appear from that part of their writings in which the
dates are noted. And this, I think, has happened through
their error in negligently copying the works of others. But we
could not find the two others now mentioned in the copies of
the chronicles which we have; yet because they are contained
in the canon, we ought not to pass them by.</p>

<p>Obadiah, so far as his writings are concerned, the briefest
of all the prophets, speaks against Idumea, that is, the nation
of Esau, that reprobate elder of the twin sons of Isaac and
grandsons of Abraham. Now if, by that form of speech in
which a part is put for the whole, we take Idumea as put
for the nations, we may understand of Christ what he says
among other things, "But upon Mount Sion shall be safety,
and there shall be a Holy One."<a name="FNanchor_529_529" id="FNanchor_529_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_529" class="fnanchor">[529]</a> And a little after, at the
end of the same prophecy, he says, "And those who are saved
again shall come up out of Mount Sion, that they may defend
Mount Esau, and it shall be a kingdom to the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id="FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> It is
quite evident this was fulfilled when those saved again out of
Mount Sion&mdash;that is, the believers in Christ from Judea, of
whom the apostles are chiefly to be acknowledged&mdash;went up
to defend Mount Esau. How could they defend it except by
making safe, through the preaching of the gospel, those who
believed that they might be "delivered from the power of
darkness and translated into the kingdom of God?"<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> This
he expressed as an inference, adding, "And it shall be to the
Lord a kingdom." For Mount Sion signifies Judea, where
it is predicted there shall be safety, and a Holy One, that is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
Christ Jesus. But Mount Esau is Idumea, which signifies
the Church of the Gentiles, which, as I have expounded, those
saved again out of Sion have defended that it should be a
kingdom to the Lord. This was obscure before it took place;
but what believer does not find it out now that it is done?</p>

<p>As for the prophet Nahum, through him God says, "I will
exterminate the graven and the molten things: I will make
thy burial. For lo, the feet of Him that bringeth good tidings
and announceth peace are swift upon the mountains! O
Judah, celebrate thy festival days, and perform thy vows; for
now they shall not go on any more so as to become antiquated.
It is completed, it is consumed, it is taken away.
He ascendeth who breathes in thy face, delivering thee out of
tribulation."<a name="FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">[532]</a> Let him that remembers the gospel call to
mind who hath ascended from hell and breathed the Holy
Spirit in the face of Judah, that is, of the Jewish disciples;
for they belong to the New Testament, whose festival days are
so spiritually renewed that they cannot become antiquated.
Moreover, we already see the graven and molten things, that
is, the idols of the false gods, exterminated through the
gospel, and given up to oblivion as of the grave, and we
know that this prophecy is fulfilled in this very thing.</p>

<p>Of what else than the advent of Christ, who was to come,
is Habakkuk understood to say, "And the Lord answered me,
and said, Write the vision openly on a tablet of boxwood, that
he that readeth these things may understand. For the vision
is yet for a time appointed, and it will arise in the end, and
will not become void: if it tarry, wait for it; because it will
surely come, and will not be delayed?"<a name="FNanchor_533_533" id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class="fnanchor">[533]</a></p>


<p class="center">32. <i>Of the prophecy that is contained in the prayer and song of Habakkuk.</i></p>

<p>In his prayer, with a song, to whom but the Lord Christ

two thieves, or between Moses and Elias talking with Him on
the mount? "While the years draw nigh, Thou wilt be recognised;
at the coming of the time Thou wilt be shown,"
does not even need exposition. "While my soul shall be
troubled at Him, in wrath Thou wilt be mindful of mercy."
What is this but that He puts Himself for the Jews, of whose
nation He was, who were troubled with great anger and crucified
Christ, when He, mindful of mercy, said, "Father, forgive
them, for they know not what they do?"<a name="FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> "God shall come
from Teman, and the Holy One from the shady and close mountain."<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id="FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class="fnanchor">[536]</a>
What is said here, "He shall come from Teman," some
interpret "from the south," or "from the south-west," by which
is signified the noonday, that is, the fervour of charity and the
splendour of truth. "The shady and close mountain" might be
understood in many ways, yet I prefer to take it as meaning
the depth of the divine Scriptures, in which Christ is prophesied:
for in the Scriptures there are many things shady and close
which exercise the mind of the reader; and Christ comes
thence when he who has understanding finds Him there.
"His power covereth up the heavens, and the earth is full of
His praise." What is this but what is also said in the psalm,
"Be Thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and Thy glory
above all the earth?"<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id="FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> "His splendour shall be as the light."
What is it but that the fame of Him shall illuminate believers?
"Horns are in His hands." What is this but the
trophy of the cross? "And He hath placed the firm charity
of His strength"<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> needs no exposition. "Before His face
shall go the word, and it shall go forth into the field after
His feet." What is this but that He should both be announced
before His coming hither and after His return
hence? "He stood, and the earth was moved." What is
this but that "He stood" for succour, "and the earth was
moved" to believe? "He regarded, and the nations melted;"
that is, He had compassion, and made the people penitent.
"The mountains are broken with violence;" that is, through
the power of those who work miracles the pride of the
haughty is broken. "The everlasting hills flowed down;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
that is, they are humbled in time that they may be lifted
up for eternity. "I saw His goings [made] eternal for His
labours;" that is, I beheld His labour of love not left without
the reward of eternity. "The tents of Ethiopia shall be greatly
afraid, and the tents of the land of Midian;" that is, even
those nations which are not under the Roman authority, being
suddenly terrified by the news of Thy wonderful works, shall
become a Christian people. "Wert Thou angry at the rivers,
O Lord? or was Thy fury against the rivers? or was Thy rage
against the sea?" This is said because He does not now
come to condemn the world, but that the world through Him
might be saved.<a name="FNanchor_539_539" id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class="fnanchor">[539]</a> "For Thou shalt mount upon Thy horses,
and Thy riding shall be salvation;" that is, Thine evangelists
shall carry Thee, for they are guided by Thee, and Thy
gospel is salvation to them that believe in Thee. "Bending,
Thou wilt bend Thy bow against the sceptres, saith the Lord;"
that is, Thou wilt threaten even the kings of the earth with
Thy judgment. "The earth shall be cleft with rivers;" that
is, by the sermons of those who preach Thee flowing in upon
them, men's hearts shall be opened to make confession, to
whom it is said, "Rend your hearts and not your garments."<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
What does "The people shall see Thee and grieve"
mean, but that in mourning they shall be blessed?<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id="FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class="fnanchor">[541]</a> What
is "Scattering the waters in marching," but that by walking in
those who everywhere proclaim Thee, Thou wilt scatter hither
and thither the streams of Thy doctrine? What is "The
abyss uttered its voice?" Is it not that the depth of the
human heart expressed what it perceived? The words, "The
depth of its phantasy," are an explanation of the previous verse,
for the depth is the abyss; and "Uttered its voice" is to be
understood before them, that is, as we have said, it expressed
what it perceived. Now the phantasy is the vision, which it
did not hold or conceal, but poured forth in confession. "The
sun was raised up, and the moon stood still in her course;"
that is, Christ ascended into heaven, and the Church was
established under her King. "Thy darts shall go in the
light;" that is, Thy words shall not be sent in secret, but
openly. For He had said to His own disciples, "What I tell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
you in darkness, that speak ye in the light."<a name="FNanchor_542_542" id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class="fnanchor">[542]</a> "By threatening
thou shalt diminish the earth;" that is, by that threatening
Thou shalt humble men. "And in fury Thou shalt cast down
the nations;" for in punishing those who exalt themselves Thou
dashest them one against another. "Thou wentest forth for
the salvation of Thy people, that Thou mightest save Thy
Christ; Thou hast sent death on the heads of the wicked."
None of these words require exposition. "Thou hast lifted
up the bonds, even to the neck." This may be understood
even of the good bonds of wisdom, that the feet may be put
into its fetters, and the neck into its collar. "Thou hast
struck off in amazement of mind the bonds" must be understood
for, He lifts up the good and strikes off the bad, about
which it is said to Him, "Thou hast broken asunder my
bonds,"<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id="FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> and that "in amazement of mind," that is, wonderfully.
"The heads of the mighty shall be moved in it;" to
wit, in that wonder. "They shall open their teeth like a poor
man eating secretly." For some of the mighty among the
Jews shall come to the Lord, admiring His works and words,
and shall greedily eat the bread of His doctrine in secret for
fear of the Jews, just as the Gospel has shown they did.
"And Thou hast sent into the sea Thy horses, troubling many
waters," which are nothing else than many people; for unless
all were troubled, some would not be converted with fear,
others pursued with fury. "I gave heed, and my belly
trembled at the voice of the prayer of my lips; and trembling
entered into my bones, and my habit of body was
troubled under me." He gave heed to those things which he
said, and was himself terrified at his own prayer, which he
had poured forth prophetically, and in which he discerned
things to come. For when many people are troubled, he saw
the threatening tribulation of the Church, and at once acknowledged
himself a member of it, and said, "I shall rest in the
day of tribulation," as being one of those who are rejoicing in
hope, patient in tribulation.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> "That I may ascend," he says,
"among the people of my pilgrimage," departing quite from the
wicked people of his carnal kinship, who are not pilgrims in
this earth, and do not seek the country above.<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id="FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> "Although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
the fig-tree," he says, "shall not blossom, neither shall fruit
be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall lie, and the fields
shall yield no meat; the sheep shall be cut off from the
meat, and there shall be no oxen in the stalls." He sees that
nation which was to slay Christ about to lose the abundance
of spiritual supplies, which, in prophetic fashion, he has set
forth by the figure of earthly plenty. And because that
nation was to suffer such wrath of God, because, being ignorant
of the righteousness of God, it wished to establish its
own,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id="FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class="fnanchor">[546]</a> he immediately says, "Yet will I rejoice in the Lord; I
will joy in God my salvation. The Lord God is my strength,
and He will set my feet in completion; He will place me
above the heights, that I may conquer in His song," to wit,
in that song of which something similar is said in the psalm,
"He set my feet upon a rock, and directed my goings, and put
in my mouth a new song, a hymn to our God."<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id="FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> He therefore
conquers in the song of the Lord, who takes pleasure in
His praise, not in his own; that "He that glorieth, let him
glory in the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">[548]</a> But some copies have, "I will joy in God
my Jesus," which seems to me better than the version of those
who, wishing to put it in Latin, have not set down that very
name which for us it is dearer and sweeter to name.</p>


<p class="center">33. <i>What Jeremiah and Zephaniah have, by the prophetic Spirit, spoken before
concerning Christ and the calling of the nations.</i></p>

<p>Jeremiah, like Isaiah, is one of the greater prophets, not of
the minor, like the others from whose writings I have just
given extracts. He prophesied when Josiah reigned in Jerusalem,
and Ancus Martius at Rome, when the captivity of the
Jews was already at hand; and he continued to prophesy
down to the fifth month of the captivity, as we find from his
writings. Zephaniah, one of the minor prophets, is put along
with him, because he himself says that he prophesied in the
days of Josiah; but he does not say till when. Jeremiah thus
prophesied not only in the times of Ancus Martius, but also
in those of Tarquinius Priscus, whom the Romans had for
their fifth king. For he had already begun to reign when
that captivity took place. Jeremiah, in prophesying of Christ,
says, "The breath of our mouth, the Lord Christ, was taken in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
our sins,"<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">[549]</a> thus briefly showing both that Christ is our Lord
and that He suffered for us. Also in another place he says,
"This is my God, and there shall none other be accounted of
in comparison of Him; who hath found out all the way of
prudence, and hath given it to Jacob His servant, and to
Israel His beloved: afterward He was seen on the earth, and
conversed with men."<a name="FNanchor_550_550" id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class="fnanchor">[550]</a> Some attribute this testimony not to
Jeremiah, but to his secretary, who was called Baruch; but it
is more commonly ascribed to Jeremiah. Again the same
prophet says concerning Him, "Behold the days come, saith
the Lord, that I will raise up unto David a righteous shoot,
and a King shall reign and shall be wise, and shall do judgment
and justice in the earth. In those days Judah shall be
saved, and Israel shall dwell confidently: and this is the
name which they shall call Him, Our righteous Lord."<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id="FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> And
of the calling of the nations which was to come to pass, and
which we now see fulfilled, he thus spoke: "O Lord my God,
and my refuge in the day of evils, to Thee shall the nations
come from the utmost end of the earth, saying, Truly our
fathers have worshipped lying images, wherein there is no
profit."<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id="FNanchor_552_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_552" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> But that the Jews, by whom He behoved even to be
slain, were not going to acknowledge Him, this prophet thus
intimates: "Heavy is the heart through all; and He is a man,
and who shall know Him?"<a name="FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">[553]</a> That passage also is his which
I have quoted in the seventeenth book concerning the new
testament, of which Christ is the Mediator. For Jeremiah
himself says, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I
will complete over the house of Jacob a new testament," and
the rest, which may be read there.<a name="FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">[554]</a></p>

<p>For the present I shall put down those predictions about
Christ by the prophet Zephaniah, who prophesied with Jeremiah.
"Wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, in the day of my
resurrection, in the future; because it is my determination to
assemble the nations, and gather together the kingdoms."<a name="FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
And again he says, "The Lord will be terrible upon them,
and will exterminate all the gods of the earth; and they shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
worship Him every man from his place, even all the isles of
the nations."<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id="FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class="fnanchor">[556]</a> And a little after he says, "Then will I turn
to the people a tongue, and to His offspring, that they may
call upon the name of the Lord, and serve Him under one
yoke. From the borders of the rivers of Ethiopia shall they
bring sacrifices unto me. In that day thou shalt not be confounded
for all thy curious inventions, which thou hast done
impiously against me: for then I will take away from thee
the naughtiness of thy trespass; and thou shalt no more
magnify thyself above thy holy mountain. And I will leave
in thee a meek and humble people, and they who shall be left
of Israel shall fear the name of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id="FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> These are the
remnant of whom the apostle quotes that which is elsewhere
prophesied: "Though the number of the children of Israel be
as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">[558]</a> These
are the remnant of that nation who have believed in Christ.</p>


<p class="center">34. <i>Of the prophecy of Daniel and Ezekiel, other two of the greater prophets.</i></p>

<p>Daniel and Ezekiel, other two of the greater prophets, also
first prophesied in the very captivity of Babylon. Daniel even
defined the time when Christ was to come and suffer by the
exact date. It would take too long to show this by computation,
and it has been done often by others before us. But of
His power and glory he has thus spoken: "I saw in a night
vision, and, behold, one like the Son of man was coming with
the clouds of heaven, and He came even to the Ancient of
days, and He was brought into His presence. And to Him
there was given dominion, and honour, and a kingdom: and
all people, tribes, and tongues shall serve Him. His power is
an everlasting power, which shall not pass away, and His
kingdom shall not be destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_559_559" id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class="fnanchor">[559]</a></p>

<p>Ezekiel also, speaking prophetically in the person of God
the Father, thus foretells Christ, speaking of Him in the prophetic
manner as David because He assumed flesh of the
seed of David, and on account of that form of a servant in
which He was made man, He who is the Son of God is also
called the servant of God. He says, "And I will set up over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
my sheep one Shepherd, who will feed them, even my servant
David; and He shall feed them, and He shall be their shepherd.
And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant
David a prince in the midst of them. I the Lord have
spoken."<a name="FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">[560]</a> And in another place he says, "And one King
shall be over them all: and they shall no more be two
nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two
kingdoms: neither shall they defile themselves any more with
their idols, and their abominations, and all their iniquities.
And I will save them out of all their dwelling-places wherein
they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall be
my people, and I will be their God. And my servant David
shall be king over them, and there shall be one Shepherd for
them all."<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id="FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class="fnanchor">[561]</a></p>


<p class="center">35. <i>Of the prophecy of the three prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi.</i></p>

<p>There remain three minor prophets, Haggai, Zechariah,
and Malachi, who prophesied at the close of the captivity.
Of these Haggai more openly prophesies of Christ and the
Church thus briefly: "Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Yet one
little while, and I will shake the heaven, and the earth, and
the sea, and the dry land; and I will move all nations, and
the desired of all nations shall come."<a name="FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> The fulfilment of
this prophecy is in part already seen, and in part hoped for
in the end. For He moved the heaven by the testimony of
the angels and the stars, when Christ became incarnate. He
moved the earth by the great miracle of His birth of the
virgin. He moved the sea and the dry land, when Christ
was proclaimed both in the isles and in the whole world. So
we see all nations moved to the faith; and the fulfilment of
what follows, "And the desired of all nations shall come," is
looked for at His last coming. For ere men can desire and
wait for Him, they must believe and love Him.</p>

<p>Zechariah says of Christ and the Church, "Rejoice greatly,
O daughter of Sion; shout joyfully, O daughter of Jerusalem:
behold, thy King shall come unto thee, just and the Saviour;
Himself poor, and mounting an ass, and a colt the foal of an
ass: and His dominion shall be from sea to sea, and from the
river even to the ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">[563]</a> How this was done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
when the Lord Christ on His journey used a beast of burden
of this kind, we read in the Gospel, where, also, as much of
this prophecy is quoted as appears sufficient for the context.
In another place, speaking in the Spirit of prophecy to Christ
Himself of the remission of sins through His blood, he says,
"Thou also, by the blood of Thy testament, hast sent forth
Thy prisoners from the lake wherein is no water."<a name="FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> Different
opinions may be held, consistently with right belief, as
to what he meant by this lake. Yet it seems to me that no
meaning suits better than that of the depth of human misery,
which is, as it were, dry and barren, where there are no
streams of righteousness, but only the mire of iniquity. For
it is said of it in the Psalms, "And He led me forth out of
the lake of misery, and from the miry clay."<a name="FNanchor_565_565" id="FNanchor_565_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_565" class="fnanchor">[565]</a></p>

<p>Malachi, foretelling the Church which we now behold propagated
through Christ, says most openly to the Jews, in the
person of God, "I have no pleasure in you, and I will not
accept a gift at your hand. For from the rising even to the
going down of the sun, my name is great among the nations;
and in every place sacrifice shall be made, and a pure oblation
shall be offered unto my name: for my name shall be great
among the nations, saith the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_566_566" id="FNanchor_566_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_566" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Since we can already
see this sacrifice offered to God in every place, from the rising
of the sun to his going down, through Christ's priesthood after
the order of Melchisedec, while the Jews, to whom it was
said, "I have no pleasure in you, neither will I accept a gift
at your hand," cannot deny that their sacrifice has ceased, why
do they still look for another Christ, when they read this in
the prophecy, and see it fulfilled, which could not be fulfilled
except through Him? And a little after he says of Him, in
the person of God, "My covenant was with Him of life and
peace; and I gave to Him that He might fear me with fear,
and be afraid before my name. The law of truth was in His
mouth: directing in peace He hath walked with me, and hath
turned many away from iniquity. For the Priest's lips shall
keep knowledge, and they shall seek the law at His mouth:
for He is the Angel of the Lord Almighty."<a name="FNanchor_567_567" id="FNanchor_567_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_567" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> Nor is it to be
wondered at that Christ Jesus is called the Angel of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Almighty God. For just as He is called a servant on account
of the form of a servant in which He came to men, so He is
called an angel on account of the <i>evangel</i> which He proclaimed
to men. For if we interpret these Greek words, <i>evangel</i> is
"good news," and <i>angel</i> is "messenger." Again he says of Him,
"Behold I will send mine angel, and He will look out the
way before my face: and the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly
come into His temple, even the Angel of the testament,
whom ye desire. Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord Almighty,
and who shall abide the day of His entry, or who shall stand
at His appearing?"<a name="FNanchor_568_568" id="FNanchor_568_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_568" class="fnanchor">[568]</a> In this place he has foretold both the
first and second advent of Christ: the first, to wit, of which he
says, "And He shall come suddenly into His temple;" that
is, into His flesh, of which He said in the Gospel, "Destroy
this temple, and in three days I will raise it up again."<a name="FNanchor_569_569" id="FNanchor_569_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_569_569" class="fnanchor">[569]</a> And
of the second advent he says, "Behold, He cometh, saith the
Lord Almighty, and who shall abide the day of His entry, or
who shall stand at His appearing?" But what he says, "The
Lord whom ye seek, and the Angel of the testament whom ye
desire," just means that even the Jews, according to the Scriptures
which they read, shall seek and desire Christ. But
many of them did not acknowledge that He whom they
sought and desired had come, being blinded in their hearts,
which were preoccupied with their own merits. Now what
he here calls the testament, either above, where he says, "My
testament had been with Him," or here, where he has called
Him the Angel of the testament, we ought, beyond a doubt, to
take to be the new testament, in which the things promised
are eternal, and not the old, in which they are only temporal.
Yet many who are weak are troubled when they see the
wicked abound in such temporal things, because they value
them greatly, and serve the true God to be rewarded with
them. On this account, to distinguish the eternal blessedness
of the new testament, which shall be given only to the
good, from the earthly felicity of the old, which for the
most part is given to the bad as well, the same prophet says,
"Ye have made your words burdensome to me: yet ye have
said, In what have we spoken ill of Thee? Ye have said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
Foolish is every one who serves God; and what profit is it
that we have kept His observances, and that we have walked
as suppliants before the face of the Lord Almighty? And
now we call the aliens blessed; yea, all that do wicked things
are built up again; yea, they are opposed to God and are
saved. They that feared the Lord uttered these reproaches
every one to his neighbour: and the Lord hearkened and
heard; and He wrote a book of remembrance before Him, for
them that fear the Lord and that revere His name."<a name="FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> By that
book is meant the New Testament. Finally, let us hear what
follows: "And they shall be an acquisition for me, saith the
Lord Almighty, in the day which I make; and I will choose
them as a man chooseth his son that serveth him. And ye
shall return, and shall discern between the just and the unjust,
and between him that serveth God and him that serveth
Him not. For, behold, the day cometh burning as an oven,
and it shall burn them up; and all the aliens and all that do
wickedly shall be stubble: and the day that shall come will
set them on fire, saith the Lord Almighty, and shall leave
neither root nor branch. And unto you that fear my name
shall the Sun of Righteousness arise, and health shall be in
His wings; and ye shall go forth, and exult as calves let loose
from bonds. And ye shall tread down the wicked, and they
shall be ashes under your feet, in the day in which I shall do
[this], saith the Lord Almighty."<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id="FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> This day is the day of judgment,
of which, if God will, we shall speak more fully in its
own place.</p>


<p class="center">36. <i>About Esdras and the books of the Maccabees.</i></p>

<p>After these three prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi,
during the same period of the liberation of the people from
the Babylonian servitude Esdras also wrote, who is historical
rather than prophetical, as is also the book called Esther, which
is found to relate, for the praise of God, events not far from
those times; unless, perhaps, Esdras is to be understood as
prophesying of Christ in that passage where, on a question
having arisen among certain young men as to what is the
strongest thing, when one had said kings, another wine, the

is the Truth. From this time, when the temple was rebuilt,
down to the time of Aristobulus, the Jews had not kings but
princes; and the reckoning of their dates is found, not in the
Holy Scriptures which are called canonical, but in others,
among which are also the books of the Maccabees. These
are held as canonical, not by the Jews, but by the Church, on
account of the extreme and wonderful sufferings of certain
martyrs, who, before Christ had come in the flesh, contended
for the law of God even unto death, and endured most grievous
and horrible evils.</p>


<p class="center">37. <i>That prophetic records are found which are more ancient than any fountain
of the Gentile philosophy.</i></p>

<p>In the time of our prophets, then, whose writings had
already come to the knowledge of almost all nations, the
philosophers of the nations had not yet arisen,&mdash;at least, not
those who were called by that name, which originated with
Pythagoras the Samian, who was becoming famous at the
time when the Jewish captivity ended. Much more, then,
are the other philosophers found to be later than the prophets.
For even Socrates the Athenian, the master of all who were
then most famous, holding the pre-eminence in that department
that is called the moral or active, is found after Esdras
in the chronicles. Plato also was born not much later, who
far outwent the other disciples of Socrates. If, besides these,
we take their predecessors, who had not yet been styled
philosophers, to wit, the seven sages, and then the physicists,
who succeeded Thales, and imitated his studious search into
the nature of things, namely, Anaximander, Anaximenes, and
Anaxagoras, and some others, before Pythagoras first professed
himself a philosopher, even these did not precede the
whole of our prophets in antiquity of time, since Thales,
whom the others succeeded, is said to have flourished in the
reign of Romulus, when the stream of prophecy burst forth
from the fountains of Israel in those writings which spread
over the whole world. So that only those theological poets,
Orpheus, Linus, and Mus√¶us, and, it may be, some others<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
among the Greeks, are found earlier in date than the Hebrew
prophets whose writings we hold as authoritative. But not
even these preceded in time our true divine, Moses, who
authentically preached the one true God, and whose writings
are first in the authoritative canon; and therefore the Greeks,
in whose tongue the literature of this age chiefly appears, have
no ground for boasting of their wisdom, in which our religion,
wherein is true wisdom, is not evidently more ancient at
least, if not superior. Yet it must be confessed that before
Moses there had already been, not indeed among the Greeks,
but among barbarous nations, as in Egypt, some doctrine
which might be called their wisdom, else it would not have
been written in the holy books that Moses was learned in all
the wisdom of the Egyptians,<a name="FNanchor_573_573" id="FNanchor_573_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_573" class="fnanchor">[573]</a> as he was, when, being born
there, and adopted and nursed by Pharaoh's daughter, he was
also liberally educated. Yet not even the wisdom of the
Egyptians could be antecedent in time to the wisdom of our
prophets, because even Abraham was a prophet. And what
wisdom could there be in Egypt before Isis had given them
letters, whom they thought fit to worship as a goddess after
her death? Now Isis is declared to have been the daughter
of Inachus, who first began to reign in Argos when the grandsons
of Abraham are known to have been already born.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>38. <i>That the ecclesiastical canon has not admitted certain writings on account
of their too great antiquity, lest through them false things should be inserted
instead of true.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>If I may recall far more ancient times, our patriarch Noah
was certainly even before that great deluge, and I might not
undeservedly call him a prophet, forasmuch as the ark he made,
in which he escaped with his family, was itself a prophecy of
our times.<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id="FNanchor_574_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_574" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> What of Enoch, the seventh from Adam? Does
not the canonical epistle of the Apostle Jude declare that he
prophesied?<a name="FNanchor_575_575" id="FNanchor_575_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_575" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> But the writings of these men could not be
held as authoritative either among the Jews or us, on account
of their too great antiquity, which made it seem needful to
regard them with suspicion, lest false things should be set
forth instead of true. For some writings which are said to
be theirs are quoted by those who, according to their own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
humour, loosely believe what they please. But the purity of
the canon has not admitted these writings, not because the
authority of these men who pleased God is rejected, but because
they are not believed to be theirs. Nor ought it to
appear strange if writings for which so great antiquity is
claimed are held in suspicion, seeing that in the very history
of the kings of Judah and Israel containing their acts, which
we believe to belong to the canonical Scripture, very many
things are mentioned which are not explained there, but are
said to be found in other books which the prophets wrote, the
very names of these prophets being sometimes given, and yet
they are not found in the canon which the people of God received.
Now I confess the reason of this is hidden from me;
only I think that even those men, to whom certainly the Holy
Spirit revealed those things which ought to be held as of religious
authority, might write some things as men by historical
diligence, and others as prophets by divine inspiration; and
these things were so distinct, that it was judged that the
former should be ascribed to themselves, but the latter to
God speaking through them: and so the one pertained to the
abundance of knowledge, the other to the authority of religion.
In that authority the canon is guarded. So that, if any writings
outside of it are now brought forward under the name of
the ancient prophets, they cannot serve even as an aid to
knowledge, because it is uncertain whether they are genuine;
and on this account they are not trusted, especially those of
them in which some things are found that are even contrary
to the truth of the canonical books, so that it is quite apparent
they do not belong to them.</p>


<p class="center">39. <i>About the Hebrew written characters which that language always possessed.</i></p>

<p>Now we must not believe that Heber, from whose name
the word Hebrew is derived, preserved and transmitted the
Hebrew language to Abraham only as a spoken language, and
that the Hebrew letters began with the giving of the law
through Moses; but rather that this language, along with its
letters, was preserved by that succession of fathers. Moses,
indeed, appointed some among the people of God to teach
letters, before they could know any letters of the divine law.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
The Scripture calls these men &#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#969;&#947;&#949;&#8150;&#962;, who may
be called in Latin <i>inductores</i> or <i>introductores</i> of letters, because
they, as it were, introduce them into the hearts of the
learners, or rather lead those whom they teach into them.
Therefore no nation could vaunt itself over our patriarchs and
prophets by any wicked vanity for the antiquity of its wisdom;
since not even Egypt, which is wont falsely and vainly to
glory in the antiquity of her doctrines, is found to have preceded
in time the wisdom of our patriarchs in her own wisdom,
such as it is. Neither will any one dare to say that they
were most skilful in wonderful sciences before they knew letters,
that is, before Isis came and taught them there. Besides, what,
for the most part, was that memorable doctrine of theirs which
was called wisdom but astronomy, and it may be some other
sciences of that kind, which usually have more power to exercise
men's wit than to enlighten their minds with true wisdom?
As regards philosophy, which professes to teach men something
which shall make them happy, studies of that kind flourished
in those lands about the times of Mercury whom they called
Trismegistus, long before the sages and philosophers of Greece,
but yet after Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, and even
after Moses himself. At that time, indeed, when Moses was
born, Atlas is found to have lived, that great astronomer, the
brother of Prometheus, and maternal grandson of the elder
Mercury, of whom that Mercury Trismegistus was the grandson.</p>


<p class="center">40. <i>About the most mendacious vanity of the Egyptians, in which they ascribe to
their science an antiquity of a hundred thousand years.</i></p>

<p>In vain, then, do some babble with most empty presumption,
saying that Egypt has understood the reckoning of the
stars for more than a hundred thousand years. For in what
books have they collected that number who learned letters
from Isis their mistress, not much more than two thousand
years ago? Varro, who has declared this, is no small authority
in history, and it does not disagree with the truth of the
divine books. For as it is not yet six thousand years since
the first man, who is called Adam, are not those to be ridiculed
rather than refuted who try to persuade us of anything regarding
a space of time so different from, and contrary to, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
ascertained truth? For what historian of the past should
we credit more than him who has also predicted things to
come which we now see fulfilled? And the very disagreement
of the historians among themselves furnishes a good
reason why we ought rather to believe him who does not
contradict the divine history which we hold. But, on the
other hand, the citizens of the impious city, scattered everywhere
through the earth, when they read the most learned
writers, none of whom seems to be of contemptible authority,
and find them disagreeing among themselves about affairs
most remote from the memory of our age, cannot find out
whom they ought to trust. But we, being sustained by divine
authority in the history of our religion, have no doubt that
whatever is opposed to it is most false, whatever may be the
case regarding other things in secular books, which, whether
true or false, yield nothing of moment to our living rightly
and happily.</p>


<p class="center">41. <i>About the discord of philosophic opinion, and the concord of the Scriptures
that are held as canonical by the Church.</i></p>

<p>But let us omit further examination of history, and return
to the philosophers from whom we digressed to these things.
They seem to have laboured in their studies for no other
end than to find out how to live in a way proper for laying
hold of blessedness. Why, then, have the disciples dissented
from their masters, and the fellow-disciples from one
another, except because as men they have sought after these
things by human sense and human reasonings? Now,
although there might be among them a desire of glory, so
that each wished to be thought wiser and more acute than
another, and in no way addicted to the judgment of others,
but the inventor of his own dogma and opinion, yet I may
grant that there were some, or even very many of them,
whose love of truth severed them from their teachers or fellow-disciples,
that they might strive for what they thought
was the truth, whether it was so or not. But what can
human misery do, or how or where can it reach forth, so as
to attain blessedness, if divine authority does not lead it?
Finally, let our authors, among whom the canon of the sacred
books is fixed and bounded, be far from disagreeing in any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
respect. It is not without good reason, then, that not merely
a few people prating in the schools and gymnasia in captious
disputations, but so many and great people, both learned and
unlearned, in countries and cities, have believed that God
spoke to them or by them, <i>i.e.</i> the canonical writers, when
they wrote these books. There ought, indeed, to be but few of
them, lest on account of their multitude what ought to be
religiously esteemed should grow cheap; and yet not so few
that their agreement should not be wonderful. For among
the multitude of philosophers, who in their works have left
behind them the monuments of their dogmas, no one will
easily find any who agree in all their opinions. But to show
this is too long a task for this work.</p>

<p>But what author of any sect is so approved in this demon-worshipping
city, that the rest who have differed from or opposed
him in opinion have been disapproved? The Epicureans
asserted that human affairs were not under the providence of
the gods; and the Stoics, holding the opposite opinion, agreed
that they were ruled and defended by favourable and tutelary
gods. Yet were not both sects famous among the Athenians?
I wonder, then, why Anaxagoras was accused of a crime for
saying that the sun was a burning stone, and denying that it
was a god at all; while in the same city Epicurus flourished
gloriously and lived securely, although he not only did not
believe that the sun or any star was a god, but contended
that neither Jupiter nor any of the gods dwelt in the world
at all, so that the prayers and supplications of men might
reach them! Were not both Aristippus and Antisthenes there,
two noble philosophers and both Socratic? yet they placed the
chief end of life within bounds so diverse and contradictory,
that the first made the delight of the body the chief good,
while the other asserted that man was made happy mainly
by the virtue of the mind. The one also said that the wise
man should flee from the republic; the other, that he should
administer its affairs. Yet did not each gather disciples to
follow his own sect? Indeed, in the conspicuous and well-known
porch, in gymnasia, in gardens, in places public and
private, they openly strove in bands each for his own opinion,
some asserting there was one world, others innumerable worlds;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
some that this world had a beginning, others that it had
not; some that it would perish, others that it would exist
always; some that it was governed by the divine mind,
others by chance and accident; some that souls are immortal,
others that they are mortal,&mdash;and of those who asserted their
immortality, some said they transmigrated through beasts,
others that it was by no means so, while of those who asserted
their mortality, some said they perished immediately after the
body, others that they survived either a little while or a longer
time, but not always; some fixing supreme good in the body,
some in the mind, some in both; others adding to the mind
and body external good things; some thinking that the bodily
senses ought to be trusted always, some not always, others
never. Now what people, senate, power, or public dignity of
the impious city has ever taken care to judge between all
these and other well-nigh innumerable dissensions of the
philosophers, approving and accepting some, and disapproving
and rejecting others? Has it not held in its bosom at random,
without any judgment, and confusedly, so many controversies
of men at variance, not about fields, houses, or anything of
a pecuniary nature, but about those things which make life
either miserable or happy? Even if some true things were
said in it, yet falsehoods were uttered with the same licence;
so that such a city has not amiss received the title of the
mystic Babylon. For Babylon means confusion, as we remember
we have already explained. Nor does it matter to
the devil, its king, how they wrangle among themselves in
contradictory errors, since all alike deservedly belong to him
on account of their great and varied impiety.</p>

<p>But that nation, that people, that city, that republic, these
Israelites, to whom the oracles of God were entrusted, by no
means confounded with similar licence false prophets with the
true prophets; but, agreeing together, and differing in nothing,
acknowledged and upheld the authentic authors of their sacred
books. These were their philosophers, these were their sages,
divines, prophets, and teachers of probity and piety. Whoever
was wise and lived according to them was wise and lived
not according to men, but according to God who hath spoken
by them. If sacrilege is forbidden there, God hath forbidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
it. If it is said, "Honour thy father and thy mother,"<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id="FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class="fnanchor">[576]</a> God
hath commanded it. If it is said, "Thou shalt not commit
adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal,"<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id="FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> and other
similar commandments, not human lips but the divine oracles
have enounced them. Whatever truth certain philosophers,
amid their false opinions, were able to see, and strove by
laborious discussions to persuade men of,&mdash;such as that God
has made this world, and Himself most providently governs
it, or of the nobility of the virtues, of the love of country, of
fidelity in friendship, of good works and everything pertaining
to virtuous manners, although they knew not to what end
and what rule all these things were to be referred,&mdash;all these, by
words prophetic, that is, divine, although spoken by men, were
commended to the people in that city, and not inculcated by
contention in arguments, so that he who should know them
might be afraid of contemning, not the wit of men, but the
oracle of God.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap42"></a>42. <i>By what dispensation of God's providence the sacred Scriptures of the Old
Testament were translated out of Hebrew into Greek, that they might be
made known to all the nations.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>One of the Ptolemies, kings of Egypt, desired to know and
have these sacred books. For after Alexander of Macedon,
who is also styled the Great, had by his most wonderful, but
by no means enduring power, subdued the whole of Asia, yea,
almost the whole world, partly by force of arms, partly by
terror, and, among other kingdoms of the East, had entered and
obtained Judea also, on his death his generals did not peaceably
divide that most ample kingdom among them for a possession,
but rather dissipated it, wasting all things by wars.
Then Egypt began to have the Ptolemies as her kings. The
first of them, the son of Lagus, carried many captive out of
Judea into Egypt. But another Ptolemy, called Philadelphus,
who succeeded him, permitted all whom he had brought under
the yoke to return free; and, more than that, sent kingly gifts
to the temple of God, and begged Eleazar, who was the high
priest, to give him the Scriptures, which he had heard by
report were truly divine, and therefore greatly desired to have
in that most noble library he had made. When the high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
priest had sent them to him in Hebrew, he afterwards demanded
interpreters of him, and there were given him seventy-two,
out of each of the twelve tribes six men, most learned in
both languages, to wit, the Hebrew and Greek; and their
translation is now by custom called the Septuagint. It is
reported, indeed, that there was an agreement in their words
so wonderful, stupendous, and plainly divine, that when they
had sat at this work, each one apart (for so it pleased Ptolemy
to test their fidelity), they differed from each other in no word
which had the same meaning and force, or in the order of the
words; but, as if the translators had been one, so what all had
translated was one, because in very deed the one Spirit had
been in them all. And they received so wonderful a gift of
God, in order that the authority of these Scriptures might be
commended not as human but divine, as indeed it was, for the
benefit of the nations who should at some time believe, as we
now see them doing.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>43. <i>Of the authority of the Septuagint translation, which, saving the honour
of the Hebrew original, is to be preferred to all translations.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>For while there were other interpreters who translated these
sacred oracles out of the Hebrew tongue into Greek, as Aquila,
Symmachus, and Theodotion, and also that translation which,
as the name of the author is unknown, is quoted as the fifth
edition, yet the Church has received this Septuagint translation
just as if it were the only one; and it has been used by
the Greek Christian people, most of whom are not aware that
there is any other. From this translation there has also been
made a translation in the Latin tongue, which the Latin
churches use. Our times, however, have enjoyed the advantage
of the presbyter Jerome, a man most learned, and skilled
in all three languages, who translated these same Scriptures
into the Latin speech, not from the Greek, but from the
Hebrew. But although the Jews acknowledge this very
learned labour of his to be faithful, while they contend that
the Septuagint translators have erred in many places, still the
churches of Christ judge that no one should be preferred to
the authority of so many men, chosen for this very great work
by Eleazar, who was then high priest; for even if there had
not appeared in them one spirit, without doubt divine, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
the seventy learned men had, after the manner of men, compared
together the words of their translation, that what pleased
them all might stand, no single translator ought to be preferred
to them; but since so great a sign of divinity has
appeared in them, certainly, if any other translator of their
Scriptures from the Hebrew into any other tongue is faithful,
in that case he agrees with these seventy translators, and if
he is not found to agree with them, then we ought to believe
that the prophetic gift is with them. For the same Spirit
who was in the prophets when they spoke these things was
also in the seventy men when they translated them, so that
assuredly they could also say something else, just as if the
prophet himself had said both, because it would be the same
Spirit who said both; and could say the same thing differently,
so that, although the words were not the same, yet the same
meaning should shine forth to those of good understanding;
and could omit or add something, so that even by this it
might be shown that there was in that work not human
bondage, which the translator owed to the words, but rather
divine power, which filled and ruled the mind of the translator.
Some, however, have thought that the Greek copies of
the Septuagint version should be emended from the Hebrew
copies; yet they did not dare to take away what the Hebrew
lacked and the Septuagint had, but only added what was
found in the Hebrew copies and was lacking in the Septuagint,
and noted them by placing at the beginning of the verses
certain marks in the form of stars which they call asterisks.
And those things which the Hebrew copies have not, but the
Septuagint have, they have in like manner marked at the
beginning of the verses by horizontal spit-shaped marks like
those by which we denote ounces; and many copies having
these marks are circulated even in Latin.<a name="FNanchor_578_578" id="FNanchor_578_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_578" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> But we cannot,
without inspecting both kinds of copies, find out those things
which are neither omitted nor added, but expressed differently,
whether they yield another meaning not in itself unsuitable,
or can be shown to explain the same meaning in another way.
If, then, as it behoves us, we behold nothing else in these
Scriptures than what the Spirit of God has spoken through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
men, if anything is in the Hebrew copies and is not in the
version of the Seventy, the Spirit of God did not choose to
say it through them, but only through the prophets. But
whatever is in the Septuagint and not in the Hebrew copies,
the same Spirit chose rather to say through the latter, thus
showing that both were prophets. For in that manner He
spoke as He chose, some things through Isaiah, some through
Jeremiah, some through several prophets, or else the same
thing through this prophet and through that. Further, whatever
is found in both editions, that one and the same Spirit
willed to say through both, but so as that the former preceded
in prophesying, and the latter followed in prophetically
interpreting them; because, as the one Spirit of peace was in
the former when they spoke true and concordant words, so the
selfsame one Spirit hath appeared in the latter, when, without
mutual conference, they yet interpreted all things as if with
one mouth.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p><a id="chap44"></a>44. <i>How the threat of the destruction of the Ninevites is to be understood, which
in the Hebrew extends to forty days, while in the Septuagint it is contracted
to three.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But some one may say, "How shall I know whether the
prophet Jonah said to the Ninevites, 'Yet <i>three</i> days and Nineveh
shall be overthrown,' or <i>forty</i> days?"<a name="FNanchor_579_579" id="FNanchor_579_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_579" class="fnanchor">[579]</a> For who does not see
that the prophet could not say both, when he was sent to
terrify the city by the threat of imminent ruin? For if its
destruction was to take place on the third day, it certainly
could not be on the fortieth; but if on the fortieth, then certainly
not on the third. If, then, I am asked which of these
Jonah may have said, I rather think what is read in the
Hebrew, "Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown."
Yet the Seventy, interpreting long afterward, could say what
was different and yet pertinent to the matter, and agree in
the selfsame meaning, although under a different signification.
And this may admonish the reader not to despise the authority
of either, but to raise himself above the history, and search for
those things which the history itself was written to set forth.
These things, indeed, took place in the city of Nineveh, but
they also signified something else too great to apply to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
city; just as, when it happened that the prophet himself was
three days in the whale's belly, it signified besides, that He
who is Lord of all the prophets should be three days in the
depths of hell. Wherefore, if that city is rightly held as
prophetically representing the Church of the Gentiles, to wit,
as brought down by penitence, so as no longer to be what it
had been, since this was done by Christ in the Church of
the Gentiles, which Nineveh represented, Christ Himself was
signified both by the forty and by the three days: by the
forty, because He spent that number of days with His disciples
after the resurrection, and then ascended into heaven, but by
the three days, because He rose on the third day. So that, if
the reader desires nothing else than to adhere to the history
of events, he may be aroused from his sleep by the Septuagint
interpreters, as well as the prophets, to search into the depth
of the prophecy, as if they had said, In the forty days seek
Him in whom thou mayest also find the three days,&mdash;the one
thou wilt find in His ascension, the other in His resurrection.
Because that which could be most suitably signified by both
numbers, of which one is used by Jonah the prophet, the other
by the prophecy of the Septuagint version, the one and selfsame
Spirit hath spoken. I dread prolixity, so that I must
not demonstrate this by many instances in which the seventy
interpreters may be thought to differ from the Hebrew, and
yet, when well understood, are found to agree. For which
reason I also, according to my capacity, following the footsteps
of the apostles, who themselves have quoted prophetic
testimonies from both, that is, from the Hebrew and the
Septuagint, have thought that both should be used as authoritative,
since both are one, and divine. But let us now follow
out as we can what remains.</p>

<p>The Jewish nation no doubt became worse after it ceased
to have prophets, just at the very time when, on the rebuilding
of the temple after the captivity in Babylon, it hoped to
become better. For so, indeed, did that carnal people understand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
what was foretold by Haggai the prophet, saying, "The
glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the

Christ, "And I will move all nations, and the desired One shall
come to all nations."<a name="FNanchor_581_581" id="FNanchor_581_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_581" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> In this passage the Septuagint translators,
giving another sense more suitable to the body than
the Head, that is, to the Church than to Christ, have said by
prophetic authority, "The things shall come that are chosen
of the Lord from all nations," that is, <i>men</i>, of whom Jesus
saith in the Gospel, "Many are called, but few are chosen."<a name="FNanchor_582_582" id="FNanchor_582_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_582" class="fnanchor">[582]</a>
For by such chosen ones of the nations there is built, through
the new testament, with living stones, a house of God far
more glorious than that temple was which was constructed
by king Solomon, and rebuilt after the captivity. For this
reason, then, that nation had no prophets from that time,
but was afflicted with many plagues by kings of alien race,
and by the Romans themselves, lest they should fancy that
this prophecy of Haggai was fulfilled by that rebuilding of
the temple.</p>

<p>For not long after, on the arrival of Alexander, it was subdued,
when, although there was no pillaging, because they dared
not resist him, and thus, being very easily subdued, received
him peaceably, yet the glory of that house was not so great
as it was when under the free power of their own kings.
Alexander, indeed, offered up sacrifices in the temple of God,
not as a convert to His worship in true piety, but thinking,
with impious folly, that He was to be worshipped along with
false gods. Then Ptolemy son of Lagus, whom I have already
mentioned, after Alexander's death carried them captive into
Egypt. His successor, Ptolemy Philadelphus, most benevolently
dismissed them; and by him it was brought about,
as I have narrated a little before, that we should have the
Septuagint version of the Scriptures. Then they were crushed
by the wars which are explained in the books of the Maccabees.
Afterward they were taken captive by Ptolemy king of Alexandria,
who was called Epiphanes. Then Antiochus king of
Syria compelled them by many and most grievous evils to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
worship idols, and filled the temple itself with the sacrilegious
superstitions of the Gentiles. Yet their most vigorous leader
Judas, who is also called Maccab√¶us, after beating the generals
of Antiochus, cleansed it from all that defilement of idolatry.</p>

<p>But not long after, one Alcimus, although an alien from the
sacerdotal tribe, was, through ambition, made pontiff, which
was an impious thing. After almost fifty years, during which
they never had peace, although they prospered in some affairs,
Aristobulus first assumed the diadem among them, and was
made both king and pontiff. Before that, indeed, from the
time of their return from the Babylonish captivity and the
rebuilding of the temple, they had not kings, but generals or
<i>principes</i>. Although a king himself may be called a prince,
from his principality in governing, and a leader, because he
leads the army, but it does not follow that all who are princes
and leaders may also be called kings, as that Aristobulus was.
He was succeeded by Alexander, also both king and pontiff,
who is reported to have reigned over them cruelly. After
him his wife Alexandra was queen of the Jews, and from her
time downwards more grievous evils pursued them; for this
Alexandra's sons, Aristobulus and Hyrcanus, when contending
with each other for the kingdom, called in the Roman
forces against the nation of Israel. For Hyrcanus asked
assistance from them against his brother. At that time
Rome had already subdued Africa and Greece, and ruled
extensively in other parts of the world also, and yet, as if
unable to bear her own weight, had, in a manner, broken
herself by her own size. For indeed she had come to grave
domestic seditions, and from that to social wars, and by and
by to civil wars, and had enfeebled and worn herself out so
much, that the changed state of the republic, in which she
should be governed by kings, was now imminent. Pompey
then, a most illustrious prince of the Roman people, having
entered Judea with an army, took the city, threw open the
temple, not with the devotion of a suppliant, but with the
authority of a conqueror, and went, not reverently, but profanely,
into the holy of holies, where it was lawful for none
but the pontiff to enter. Having established Hyrcanus in the
pontificate, and set Antipater over the subjugated nation as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
guardian or procurator, as they were then called, he led
Aristobulus with him bound. From that time the Jews also
began to be Roman tributaries. Afterward Cassius plundered
the very temple. Then after a few years it was their desert
to have Herod, a king of foreign birth, in whose reign Christ
was born. For the time had now come signified by the
prophetic Spirit through the mouth of the patriarch Jacob,
when he says, "There shall not be lacking a prince out of
Judah, nor a teacher from his loins, until He shall come for
whom it is reserved; and He is the expectation of the nations."<a name="FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">[583]</a>
There lacked not therefore a Jewish prince of the Jews until
that Herod, who was the first king of a foreign race received
by them. Therefore it was now the time when He should
come for whom that was reserved which is promised in the
New Testament, that He should be the expectation of the
nations. But it was not possible that the nations should
expect He would come, as we see they did, to do judgment in
the splendour of power, unless they should first believe in
Him when He came to suffer judgment in the humility of
patience.</p>

<p>46. <i>Of the birth of our Saviour, whereby the Word was made flesh; and of the

<p>While Herod, therefore, reigned in Judea, and C√¶sar
Augustus was emperor at Rome, the state of the republic
being already changed, and the world being set at peace by
him, Christ was born in Bethlehem of Judah, man manifest out
of a human virgin, God hidden out of God the Father. For so
had the prophet foretold: "Behold, a virgin shall conceive in

Immanuel, which, being interpreted, is, God with us."<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id="FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> He
did many miracles that He might commend God in Himself,
some of which, even as many as seemed sufficient to proclaim
Him, are contained in the evangelic Scripture. The first of
these is, that He was so wonderfully born, and the last, that
with His body raised up again from the dead He ascended
into heaven. But the Jews who slew Him, and would not
believe in Him, because it behoved Him to die and rise again,
were yet more miserably wasted by the Romans, and utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
rooted out from their kingdom, where aliens had already
ruled over them, and were dispersed through the lands (so
that indeed there is no place where they are not), and are
thus by their own Scriptures a testimony to us that we have
not forged the prophecies about Christ. And very many of
them, considering this, even before His passion, but chiefly
after His resurrection, believed on Him, of whom it was predicted,
"Though the number of the children of Israel be as
the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved."<a name="FNanchor_585_585" id="FNanchor_585_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_585" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> But the
rest are blinded, of whom it was predicted, "Let their table
be made before them a trap, and a retribution, and a stumbling-block.
Let their eyes be darkened lest they see, and bow
down their back alway."<a name="FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">[586]</a> Therefore, when they do not believe
our Scriptures, their own, which they blindly read, are
fulfilled in them, lest perchance any one should say that the
Christians have forged these prophecies about Christ which
are quoted under the name of the sibyl, or of others, if such
there be, who do not belong to the Jewish people. For us,
indeed, those suffice which are quoted from the books of our
enemies, to whom we make our acknowledgment, on account
of this testimony which, in spite of themselves, they contribute
by their possession of these books, while they themselves are
dispersed among all nations, wherever the Church of Christ
is spread abroad. For a prophecy about this thing was sent
before in the Psalms, which they also read, where it is written,
"My God, His mercy shall prevent me. My God hath shown
me concerning mine enemies, that Thou shalt not slay them,
lest they should at last forget Thy law: disperse them in Thy
might."<a name="FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> Therefore God has shown the Church in her enemies
the Jews the grace of His compassion, since, as saith the
apostle, "their offence is the salvation of the Gentiles."<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id="FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
And therefore He has not slain them, that is, He has not let
the knowledge that they are Jews be lost in them, although
they have been conquered by the Romans, lest they should
forget the law of God, and their testimony should be of no
avail in this matter of which we treat. But it was not
enough that he should say, "Slay them not, lest they should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
at last forget Thy law," unless he had also added, "Disperse
them;" because if they had only been in their own land with
that testimony of the Scriptures, and not everywhere, certainly
the Church which is everywhere could not have had them as
witnesses among all nations to the prophecies which were
sent before concerning Christ.</p>


<p class="center">47. <i>Whether before Christian times there were any outside of the Israelite
race who belonged to the fellowship of the heavenly city.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore if we read of any foreigner&mdash;that is, one neither
born of Israel nor received by that people into the canon of
the sacred books&mdash;having prophesied something about Christ,
if it has come or shall come to our knowledge, we can refer
to it over and above; not that this is necessary, even if
wanting, but because it is not incongruous to believe that
even in other nations there may have been men to whom this
mystery was revealed, and who were also impelled to proclaim
it, whether they were partakers of the same grace or had no
experience of it, but were taught by bad angels, who, as we
know, even confessed the present Christ, whom the Jews did
not acknowledge. Nor do I think the Jews themselves dare
contend that no one has belonged to God except the Israelites,
since the increase of Israel began on the rejection of his elder
brother. For in very deed there was no other people who
were specially called the people of God; but they cannot
deny that there have been certain men even of other nations
who belonged, not by earthly but heavenly fellowship, to the
true Israelites, the citizens of the country that is above. Because,
if they deny this, they can be most easily confuted by
the case of the holy and wonderful man Job, who was neither
a native nor a proselyte, that is, a stranger joining the people
of Israel, but, being bred of the Idumean race, arose there
and died there too, and who is so praised by the divine oracle,
that no man of his times is put on a level with him as regards
justice and piety. And although we do not find his date in
the chronicles, yet from his book, which for its merit the
Israelites have received as of canonical authority, we gather
that he was in the third generation after Israel. And I
doubt not it was divinely provided, that from this one case
we might know that among other nations also there might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
men pertaining to the spiritual Jerusalem who have lived
according to God and have pleased Him. And it is not to
be supposed that this was granted to any one, unless the one
Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,<a name="FNanchor_589_589" id="FNanchor_589_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_589" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> was
divinely revealed to him; who was pre-announced to the saints
of old as yet to come in the flesh, even as He is announced
to us as having come, that the selfsame faith through Him
may lead all to God who are predestinated to be the city of
God, the house of God, and the temple of God. But whatever
prophecies concerning the grace of God through Christ
Jesus are quoted, they may be thought to have been forged
by the Christians. So that there is nothing of more weight
for confuting all sorts of aliens, if they contend about this
matter, and for supporting our friends, if they are truly wise,
than to quote those divine predictions about Christ which
are written in the books of the Jews, who have been torn from
their native abode and dispersed over the whole world in
order to bear this testimony, so that the Church of Christ has
everywhere increased.</p>

<p>This house of God is more glorious than that first one
which was constructed of wood and stone, metals, and other
precious things. Therefore the prophecy of Haggai was not
fulfilled in the rebuilding of that temple. For it can never
be shown to have had so much glory after it was rebuilt as
it had in the time of Solomon; yea, rather, the glory of that
house is shown to have been diminished, first by the ceasing
of prophecy, and then by the nation itself suffering so great
calamities, even to the final destruction made by the Romans,
as the things above-mentioned prove. But this house which
pertains to the new testament is just as much more glorious
as the living stones, even believing, renewed men, of which it
is constructed are better. But it was typified by the rebuilding
of that temple for this reason, because the very renovation
of that edifice typifies in the prophetic oracle another testament
which is called the new. When, therefore, God said by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
the prophet just named, "And I will give peace in this
place,"<a name="FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">[591]</a> He is to be understood who is typified by that typical
place; for since by that rebuilt place is typified the Church
which was to be built by Christ, nothing else can be accepted
as the meaning of the saying, "I will give peace in this
place," except I will give peace in the place which that place
signifies. For all typical things seem in some way to personate
those whom they typify, as it is said by the apostle,
"That Rock was Christ."<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id="FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Therefore the glory of this new
testament house is greater than the glory of the old testament
house; and it will show itself as greater when it shall
be dedicated. For then "shall come the desired of all nations,"<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id="FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class="fnanchor">[593]</a>
as we read in the Hebrew. For before His advent
He had not yet been desired by all nations. For they knew
not Him whom they ought to desire, in whom they had not
believed. Then, also, according to the Septuagint interpretation
(for it also is a prophetic meaning), "shall come those
who are elected of the Lord out of all nations." For then
indeed there shall come only those who are elected, whereof
the apostle saith, "According as He hath chosen us in Him
before the foundation of the world."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id="FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class="fnanchor">[594]</a> For the Master
Builder who said, "Many are called, but few are chosen,"<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">[595]</a>
did not say this of those who, on being called, came in such
a way as to be cast out from the feast, but would point out
the house built up of the elect, which henceforth shall dread
no ruin. Yet because the churches are also full of those who
shall be separated by the winnowing as in the threshing-floor,
the glory of this house is not so apparent now as it shall be
when every one who is there shall be there always.</p>


<p class="center">49. <i>Of the indiscriminate increase of the Church, wherein many reprobate are in
this world mixed with the elect.</i></p>

<p>In this wicked world, in these evil days, when the Church
measures her future loftiness by her present humility, and is
exercised by goading fears, tormenting sorrows, disquieting
labours, and dangerous temptations, when she soberly rejoices,
rejoicing only in hope, there are many reprobate mingled with
the good, and both are gathered together by the gospel as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
a drag net;<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id="FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> and in this world, as in a sea, both swim enclosed
without distinction in the net, until it is brought ashore, when
the wicked must be separated from the good, that in the good,
as in His temple, God may be all in all. We acknowledge,
indeed, that His word is now fulfilled who spake in the psalm,
and said, "I have announced and spoken; they are multiplied
above number."<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id="FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> This takes place now, since He has spoken,
first by the mouth of his forerunner John, and afterward by
His own mouth, saying, "Repent: for the kingdom of heaven
is at hand."<a name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> He chose disciples, whom He also called apostles,<a name="FNanchor_599_599" id="FNanchor_599_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_599" class="fnanchor">[599]</a>
of lowly birth, unhonoured, and illiterate, so that whatever
great thing they might be or do, He might be and do it in
them. He had one among them whose wickedness He could
use well in order to accomplish His appointed passion, and
furnish His Church an example of bearing with the wicked.
Having sown the holy gospel as much as that behoved to be
done by His bodily presence, He suffered, died, and rose again,
showing by His passion what we ought to suffer for the truth,
and by His resurrection what we ought to hope for in adversity;
saving always the mystery of the sacrament, by which
His blood was shed for the remission of sins. He held converse
on the earth forty days with His disciples, and in their
sight ascended into heaven, and after ten days sent the promised
Holy Spirit. It was given as the chief and most necessary
sign of His coming on those who had believed, that every
one of them spoke in the tongues of all nations; thus signifying
that the unity of the catholic Church would embrace all
nations, and would in like manner speak in all tongues.</p>


<p class="center">50. <i>Of the preaching of the gospel, which is made more famous and powerful
by the sufferings of its preachers.</i></p>

<p>Then was fulfilled that prophecy, "Out of Sion shall go
forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem;"<a name="FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">[600]</a>
and the prediction of the Lord Christ Himself, when, after the
resurrection, "He opened the understanding" of His amazed
disciples "that they might understand the Scriptures, and
said unto them that thus it is written, and thus it behoved
Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in
His name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> And
again, when, in reply to their questioning about the day of
His last coming, He said, "It is not for you to know the
times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own
power; but ye shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost
coming upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in
Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and even unto the
ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id="FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> First of all, the Church spread herself
abroad from Jerusalem; and when very many in Judea and
Samaria had believed, she also went into other nations by
those who announced the gospel, whom, as lights, He Himself
had both prepared by His word and kindled by His Holy
Spirit. For He had said to them, "Fear ye not them which
kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul."<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> And that
they might not be frozen with fear, they burned with the fire
of charity. Finally, the gospel of Christ was preached in the
whole world, not only by those who had seen and heard Him
both before His passion and after His resurrection, but also after
their death by their successors, amid the horrible persecutions,
diverse torments and deaths of the martyrs, God also bearing
them witness, both with signs and wonders, and divers miracles
and gifts of the Holy Ghost,<a name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> that the people of the nations,
believing in Him who was crucified for their redemption, might
venerate with Christian love the blood of the martyrs which
they had poured forth with devilish fury, and the very kings
by whose laws the Church had been laid waste might become
profitably subject to that name they had cruelly striven to
take away from the earth, and might begin to persecute the
false gods for whose sake the worshippers of the true God had
formerly been persecuted.</p>


<p class="center">51. <i>That the catholic faith may be confirmed even by the dissensions of the
heretics.</i></p>

<p>But the devil, seeing the temples of the demons deserted,
and the human race running to the name of the liberating
Mediator, has moved the heretics under the Christian name
to resist the Christian doctrine, as if they could be kept in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the city of God indifferently without any correction, just as
the city of confusion indifferently held the philosophers who
were of diverse and adverse opinions. Those, therefore, in
the Church of Christ who savour anything morbid and depraved,
and, on being corrected that they may savour what
is wholesome and right, contumaciously resist, and will not
amend their pestiferous and deadly dogmas, but persist in defending
them, become heretics, and, going without, are to be
reckoned as enemies who serve for her discipline. For even
thus they profit by their wickedness those true catholic members
of Christ, since God makes a good use even of the wicked,
and all things work together for good to them that love Him.<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id="FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class="fnanchor">[605]</a>
For all the enemies of the Church, whatever error blinds or
malice depraves them, exercise her patience if they receive
the power to afflict her corporally; and if they only oppose
her by wicked thought, they exercise her wisdom: but at
the same time, if these enemies are loved, they exercise her
benevolence, or even her beneficence, whether she deals with
them by persuasive doctrine or by terrible discipline. And
thus the devil, the prince of the impious city, when he stirs
up his own vessels against the city of God that sojourns in
this world, is permitted to do her no harm. For without
doubt the divine providence procures for her both consolation
through prosperity, that she may not be broken by adversity,
and trial through adversity, that she may not be corrupted by
prosperity; and thus each is tempered by the other, as we
recognise in the Psalms that voice which arises from no other
cause, "According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart,
Thy consolations have delighted my soul."<a name="FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> Hence also is
that saying of the apostle, "Rejoicing in hope, patient in
tribulation."<a name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<p>For it is not to be thought that what the same teacher
says can at any time fail, "Whoever will live piously in
Christ shall suffer persecution."<a name="FNanchor_608_608" id="FNanchor_608_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_608" class="fnanchor">[608]</a> Because even when those
who are without do not rage, and thus there seems to be, and
really is, tranquillity, which brings very much consolation,
especially to the weak, yet there are not wanting, yea, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
are many within who by their abandoned manners torment
the hearts of those who live piously, since by them the
Christian and catholic name is blasphemed; and the dearer
that name is to those who will live piously in Christ, the
more do they grieve that through the wicked, who have a
place within, it comes to be less loved than pious minds
desire. The heretics themselves also, since they are thought
to have the Christian name and sacraments, Scriptures, and
profession, cause great grief in the hearts of the pious, both
because many who wish to be Christians are compelled by
their dissensions to hesitate, and many evil-speakers also find
in them matter for blaspheming the Christian name, because
they too are at any rate <i>called</i> Christians. By these and
similar depraved manners and errors of men, those who will
live piously in Christ suffer persecution, even when no one
molests or vexes their body; for they suffer this persecution,
not in their bodies, but in their hearts. Whence is that word,
"According to the multitude of my griefs in my heart;" for
he does not say, in my body. Yet, on the other hand, none
of them can perish, because the immutable divine promises
are thought of. And because the apostle says, "The Lord
knoweth them that are His;<a name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> for whom He did foreknow, He
also predestinated [to be] conformed to the image of His
Son,"<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id="FNanchor_610_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_610" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> none of them can perish; therefore it follows in that
psalm, "Thy consolations have delighted my soul."<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id="FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> But
that grief which arises in the hearts of the pious, who are
persecuted by the manners of bad or false Christians, is profitable
to the sufferers, because it proceeds from the charity
in which they do not wish them either to perish or to hinder
the salvation of others. Finally, great consolations grow out
of their chastisement, which imbue the souls of the pious
with a fecundity as great as the pains with which they were
troubled concerning their own perdition. Thus in this world,
in these evil days, not only from the time of the bodily presence
of Christ and His apostles, but even from that of Abel,
whom first his wicked brother slew because he was righteous,<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">[612]</a>
and thenceforth even to the end of this world, the Church has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
gone forward on pilgrimage amid the persecutions of the
world and the consolations of God.</p>

Diocletian and Maximian. For as there were ten plagues
in Egypt before the people of God could begin to go out,
they think this is to be referred to as showing that the last
persecution by Antichrist must be like the eleventh plague,
in which the Egyptians, while following the Hebrews with
hostility, perished in the Red Sea when the people of God
passed through on dry land. Yet I do not think persecutions
were prophetically signified by what was done in Egypt, however
nicely and ingeniously those who think so may seem to
have compared the two in detail, not by the prophetic Spirit,
but by the conjecture of the human mind, which sometimes
hits the truth, and sometimes is deceived. But what can
those who think this say of the persecution in which the
Lord Himself was crucified? In which number will they
put it? And if they think the reckoning is to be made exclusive
of this one, as if those must be counted which pertain
to the body, and not that in which the Head Himself was set
upon and slain, what can they make of that one which, after
Christ ascended into heaven, took place in Jerusalem, when
the blessed Stephen was stoned; when James the brother of
John was slaughtered with the sword; when the Apostle
Peter was imprisoned to be killed, and was set free by the
angel; when the brethren were driven away and scattered
from Jerusalem; when Saul, who afterward became the
Apostle Paul, wasted the Church; and when he himself, publishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
the glad tidings of the faith he had persecuted, suffered
such things as he had inflicted, either from the Jews or from
other nations, where he most fervently preached Christ everywhere?
Why, then, do they think fit to start with Nero,
when the Church in her growth had reached the times of
Nero amid the most cruel persecutions, about which it would
be too long to say anything? But if they think that only
the persecutions made by kings ought to be reckoned, it was
king Herod who also made a most grievous one after the
ascension of the Lord. And what account do they give of
Julian, whom they do not number in the ten? Did not he
persecute the Church, who forbade the Christians to teach or
learn liberal letters? Under him, the elder Valentinian, who
was the third emperor after him, stood forth as a confessor of
the Christian faith, and was dismissed from his command in
the army. I shall say nothing of what he did at Antioch,
except to mention his being struck with wonder at the freedom
and cheerfulness of one most faithful and stedfast young
man, who, when many were seized to be tortured, was tortured
during a whole day, and sang under the instrument of torture,
until the emperor feared lest he should succumb under the
continued cruelties and put him to shame at last, which made
him dread and fear that he would be yet more dishonourably
put to the blush by the rest. Lastly, within our own recollection,
did not Valens the Arian, brother of the foresaid
Valentinian, waste the catholic Church by great persecution
throughout the East? But how unreasonable it is not to
consider that the Church, which bears fruit and grows through
the whole world, may suffer persecution from kings in some
nations even when she does not suffer it in others! Perhaps,
however, it was not to be reckoned a persecution when the
king of the Goths, in Gothia itself, persecuted the Christians
with wonderful cruelty, when there were none but catholics
there, of whom very many were crowned with martyrdom, as we
have heard from certain brethren who had been there at that
time as boys, and unhesitatingly called to mind that they had
seen these things? And what took place in Persia of late?
Was not persecution so hot against the Christians (if even yet
it is allayed) that some of the fugitives from it came even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
Roman towns? When I think of these and the like things,
it does not seem to me that the number of persecutions with
which the Church is to be tried can be definitely stated. But,
on the other hand, it is no less rash to affirm that there will
be some persecutions by kings besides that last one, about
which no Christian is in doubt. Therefore we leave this undecided,
supporting or refuting neither side of this question,
but only restraining men from the audacious presumption of
affirming either of them.</p>


<p class="center">53. <i>Of the hidden time of the final persecution.</i></p>

<p>Truly Jesus Himself shall extinguish by His presence that
last persecution which is to be made by Antichrist. For so
it is written, that "He shall slay him with the breath of His
mouth, and empty him with the brightness of His presence."<a name="FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">[613]</a>
It is customary to ask, When shall that be? But this is
quite unreasonable. For had it been profitable for us to
know this, by whom could it better have been told than by
God Himself, the Master, when the disciples questioned Him?
For they were not silent when with Him, but inquired of
Him, saying, "Lord, wilt Thou at this time present the kingdom
to Israel, or when?"<a name="FNanchor_614_614" id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> But He said, "It is not for you
to know the times, which the Father hath put in His own
power." When they got that answer, they had not at all
questioned Him about the hour, or day, or year, but about the
time. In vain, then, do we attempt to compute definitely the
years that may remain to this world, when we may hear from
the mouth of the Truth that it is not for us to know this.
Yet some have said that four hundred, some five hundred,
others a thousand years, may be completed from the ascension
of the Lord up to His final coming. But to point out how
each of them supports his own opinion would take too long,
and is not necessary; for indeed they use human conjectures,
and bring forward nothing certain from the authority of the
canonical Scriptures. But on this subject He puts aside the
figures of the calculators, and orders silence, who says, "It is
not for you to know the times, which the Father hath put in
His own power."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>But because this sentence is in the Gospel, it is no wonder
that the worshippers of the many and false gods have been
none the less restrained from feigning that by the responses
of the demons, whom they worship as gods, it has been fixed
how long the Christian religion is to last. For when they
saw that it could not be consumed by so many and great persecutions,
but rather drew from them wonderful enlargements,
they invented I know not what Greek verses, as if poured
forth by a divine oracle to some one consulting it, in which,
indeed, they make Christ innocent of this, as it were, sacrilegious
crime, but add that Peter by enchantments brought it
about that the name of Christ should be worshipped for three
hundred and sixty-five years, and, after the completion of
that number of years, should at once take end. Oh the hearts
of learned men! Oh, learned wits, meet to believe such things
<i>about</i> Christ as you are not willing to believe <i>in</i> Christ, that
His disciple Peter did not learn magic arts from Him, yet
that, although He was innocent, His disciple was an enchanter,
and chose that His name rather than his own should be worshipped
through his magic arts, his great labours and perils,
and at last even the shedding of his blood! If Peter the
enchanter made the world so love Christ, what did Christ the
innocent do to make Peter so love Him? Let them answer
themselves then, and, if they can, let them understand that
the world, for the sake of eternal life, was made to love Christ
by that same supernal grace which made Peter also love
Christ for the sake of the eternal life to be received from
Him, and that even to the extent of suffering temporal death
for Him. And then, what kind of gods are these who are
able to predict such things, yet are not able to avert them,
succumbing in such a way to a single enchanter and wicked
magician (who, as they say, having slain a yearling boy and
torn him to pieces, buried him with nefarious rites), that
they permitted the sect hostile to themselves to gain strength
for so great a time, and to surmount the horrid cruelties of so
many great persecutions, not by resisting but by suffering, and
to procure the overthrow of their own images, temples, rituals,
and oracles? Finally, what god was it&mdash;not ours, certainly,
but one of their own&mdash;who was either enticed or compelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
by so great wickedness to perform these things? For those
verses say that Peter bound, not any demon, but a god to do
these things. Such a god have they who have not Christ.</p>


<p class="center">54. <i>Of the very foolish lie of the pagans, in feigning that the Christian religion
was not to last beyond three hundred and sixty-five years.</i></p>

<p>I might collect these and many similar arguments, if that
year had not already passed by which lying divination has
promised, and deceived vanity has believed. But as a few
years ago three hundred and sixty-five years were completed
since the time when the worship of the name of Christ was
established by His presence in the flesh, and by the apostles,
what other proof need we seek to refute that falsehood? For,
not to place the beginning of this period at the nativity of
Christ, because as an infant and boy He had no disciples, yet,
when He began to have them, beyond doubt the Christian
doctrine and religion then became known through His bodily
presence, that is, after He was baptized in the river Jordan
by the ministry of John. For on this account that prophecy
went before concerning Him: "He shall reign from sea even
to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">[615]</a>
But since, before He suffered and rose from the dead, the faith
had not yet been defined to all, but was defined in the resurrection
of Christ (for so the Apostle Paul speaks to the
Athenians, saying, "But now He announces to men that all
everywhere should repent, because He hath appointed a day
in which to judge the world in equity, by the Man in whom
He hath defined the faith to all men, raising Him from the
dead"<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id="FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class="fnanchor">[616]</a>), it is better that, in settling this question, we should
start from that point, especially because the Holy Spirit was
then given, just as He behoved to be given after the resurrection
of Christ in that city from which the second law, that
is, the new testament, ought to begin. For the first, which
is called the old testament, was given from Mount Sinai
through Moses. But concerning this which was to be given
by Christ it was predicted, "Out of Sion shall go forth the
law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem;"<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> whence
He Himself said, that repentance in His name behoved to be
preached among all nations, but yet beginning at Jerusalem.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">[618]</a>
There, therefore, the worship of this name took its rise, that
Jesus should be believed in, who died and rose again. There
this faith blazed up with such noble beginnings, that several
thousand men, being converted to the name of Christ with
wonderful alacrity, sold their goods for distribution among the
needy, thus, by a holy resolution and most ardent charity,
coming to voluntary poverty, and prepared themselves, amid
the Jews who raged and thirsted for their blood, to contend
for the truth even to death, not with armed power, but with
more powerful patience. If this was accomplished by no
magic arts, why do they hesitate to believe that the other
could be done throughout the whole world by the same divine
power by which this was done? But supposing Peter wrought
that enchantment so that so great a multitude of men at
Jerusalem was thus kindled to worship the name of Christ,
who had either seized and fastened Him to the cross, or reviled
Him when fastened there, we must still inquire when
the three hundred and sixty-five years must be completed,
counting from that year. Now Christ died when the Gemini
were consuls, on the eighth day before the kalends of April.
He rose the third day, as the apostles have proved by the
evidence of their own senses. Then forty days after, He
ascended into heaven. Ten days after, that is, on the fiftieth
after His resurrection, He sent the Holy Spirit; then three
thousand men believed when the apostles preached Him.
Then, therefore, arose the worship of that name, as we believe,
and according to the real truth, by the efficacy of the
Holy Spirit, but, as impious vanity has feigned or thought,
by the magic arts of Peter. A little afterward, too, on a
wonderful sign being wrought, when at Peter's own word a
certain beggar, so lame from his mother's womb that he was
carried by others and laid down at the gate of the temple,
where he begged alms, was made whole in the name of Jesus
Christ, and leaped up, five thousand men believed, and thenceforth
the Church grew by sundry accessions of believers. Thus
we gather the very day with which that year began, namely,
that on which the Holy Spirit was sent, that is, during the
ides of May. And, on counting the consuls, the three hundred
and sixty-five years are found completed on the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
ides in the consulate of Honorius and Eutychianus. Now, in
the following year, in the consulate of Mallius Theodorus,
when, according to that oracle of the demons or figment of
men, there ought already to have been no Christian religion,
it was not necessary to inquire what perchance was done in
other parts of the earth. But, as we know, in the most noted
and eminent city Carthage, in Africa, Gaudentius and Jovius,
officers of the Emperor Honorius, on the fourteenth day before
the kalends of April, overthrew the temples and broke the
images of the false gods. And from that time to the present,
during almost thirty years, who does not see how much the
worship of the name of Christ has increased, especially after
many of those became Christians who had been kept back from
the faith by thinking that divination true, but saw when that
same number of years was completed that it was empty and
ridiculous? We, therefore, who are called and <i>are</i> Christians,
do not believe in Peter, but in Him whom Peter believed,&mdash;being
edified by Peter's sermons about Christ, not poisoned by
his incantations; and not deceived by his enchantments, but
aided by his good deeds. Christ Himself, who was Peter's
Master in the doctrine which leads to eternal life, is our
Master too.</p>

<p>But let us now at last finish this book, after thus far treating
of, and showing as far as seemed sufficient, what is the
mortal course of the two cities, the heavenly and the earthly,
which are mingled together from the beginning down to the
end. Of these, the earthly one has made to herself of whom
she would, either from any other quarter, or even from among
men, false gods whom she might serve by sacrifice; but she
which is heavenly, and is a pilgrim on the earth, does not
make false gods, but is herself made by the true God, of
whom she herself must be the true sacrifice. Yet both alike
either enjoy temporal good things, or are afflicted with temporal
evils, but with diverse faith, diverse hope, and diverse
love, until they must be separated by the last judgment, and
each must receive her own end, of which there is no end.
About these ends of both we must next treat.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>1. <i>That Varro has made out that two hundred and eighty-eight different sects
of philosophy might be formed by the various opinions regarding the
supreme good.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>As I see that I have still to discuss the fit destinies of the
two cities, the earthly and the heavenly, I must first
explain, so far as the limits of this work allow me, the reasonings
by which men have attempted to make for themselves a
happiness in this unhappy life, in order that it may be evident,
not only from divine authority, but also from such reasons
as can be adduced to unbelievers, how the empty dreams of
the philosophers differ from the hope which God gives to us,
and from the substantial fulfilment of it which He will give
us as our blessedness. Philosophers have expressed a great
variety of diverse opinions regarding the ends of goods and of
evils, and this question they have eagerly canvassed, that they
might, if possible, discover what makes a man happy. For
the end of our good is that for the sake of which other things
are to be desired, while it is to be desired for its own sake;
and the end of evil is that on account of which other things
are to be shunned, while it is avoided on its own account.
Thus, by the <i>end of good</i>, we at present mean, not that by
which good is destroyed, so that it no longer exists, but that
by which it is finished, so that it becomes complete; and by
the <i>end of evil</i> we mean, not that which abolishes it, but that
which completes its development. These two ends, therefore,
are the supreme good and the supreme evil; and, as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
said, those who have in this vain life professed the study of
wisdom have been at great pains to discover these ends, and
to obtain the supreme good and avoid the supreme evil in
this life. And although they erred in a variety of ways, yet
natural insight has prevented them from wandering from the
truth so far that they have not placed the supreme good and
evil, some in the soul, some in the body, and some in both.
From this tripartite distribution of the sects of philosophy,
Marcus Varro, in his book <i>De Philosophia</i>,<a name="FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> has drawn so large
a variety of opinions, that, by a subtle and minute analysis of
distinctions, he numbers without difficulty as many as 288
sects,&mdash;not that these have actually existed, but sects which
are possible.</p>

<p>To illustrate briefly what he means, I must begin with his
own introductory statement in the above-mentioned book,
that there are four things which men desire, as it were by
nature without a master, without the help of any instruction,
without industry or the art of living which is called virtue,
and which is certainly learned:<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id="FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class="fnanchor">[620]</a> either pleasure, which is
an agreeable stirring of the bodily sense; or repose, which
excludes every bodily inconvenience; or both these, which
Epicurus calls by the one name, pleasure; or the primary
objects of nature,<a name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">[621]</a> which comprehend the things already named
and other things, either bodily, such as health, and safety, and
integrity of the members, or spiritual, such as the greater and
less mental gifts that are found in men. Now these four
things&mdash;pleasure, repose, the two combined, and the primary
objects of nature&mdash;exist in us in such sort that we must either
desire virtue on their account, or them for the sake of virtue,
or both for their own sake; and consequently there arise from
this distinction twelve sects, for each is by this consideration
tripled. I will illustrate this in one instance, and, having
done so, it will not be difficult to understand the others.
According, then, as bodily pleasure is subjected, preferred, or
united to virtue, there are three sects. It is subjected to
virtue when it is chosen as subservient to virtue. Thus it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
a duty of virtue to live for one's country, and for its sake to
beget children, neither of which can be done without bodily
pleasure. For there is pleasure in eating and drinking, pleasure
also in sexual intercourse. But when it is preferred to
virtue, it is desired for its own sake, and virtue is chosen only
for its sake, and to effect nothing else than the attainment or
preservation of bodily pleasure. And this, indeed, is to make
life hideous; for where virtue is the slave of pleasure it no
longer deserves the name of virtue. Yet even this disgraceful
distortion has found some philosophers to patronize and
defend it. Then virtue is united to pleasure when neither is
desired for the other's sake, but both for their own. And
therefore, as pleasure, according as it is subjected, preferred, or
united to virtue, makes three sects, so also do repose, pleasure
and repose combined, and the prime natural blessings,
make their three sects each. For as men's opinions vary, and
these four things are sometimes subjected, sometimes preferred,
and sometimes united to virtue, there are produced twelve
sects. But this number again is doubled by the addition of
one difference, viz. the social life; for whoever attaches himself
to any of these sects does so either for his own sake alone,
or for the sake of a companion, for whom he ought to wish
what he desires for himself. And thus there will be twelve
of those who think some one of these opinions should be held
for their own sakes, and other twelve who decide that they
ought to follow this or that philosophy not for their own sakes
only, but also for the sake of others whose good they desire as
their own. These twenty-four sects again are doubled, and
become forty-eight by adding a difference taken from the New
Academy. For each of these four and twenty sects can hold
and defend their opinion as certain, as the Stoics defended the
position that the supreme good of man consisted solely in
virtue; or they can be held as probable, but not certain, as
the New Academics did. There are, therefore, twenty-four
who hold their philosophy as certainly true, other twenty-four
who hold their opinions as probable, but not certain.
Again, as each person who attaches himself to any of these
sects may adopt the mode of life either of the Cynics or of
the other philosophers, this distinction will double the number,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
and so make ninety-six sects. Then, lastly, as each of these
sects may be adhered to either by men who love a life of ease,
as those who have through choice or necessity addicted themselves
to study, or by men who love a busy life, as those who,
while philosophizing, have been much occupied with state
affairs and public business, or by men who choose a mixed life,
in imitation of those who have apportioned their time partly
to erudite leisure, partly to necessary business: by these differences
the number of the sects is tripled, and becomes 288.</p>

<p>I have thus, as briefly and lucidly as I could, given in my
own words the opinions which Varro expresses in his book.
But how he refutes all the rest of these sects, and chooses one,
the Old Academy, instituted by Plato, and continuing to
Polemo, the fourth teacher of that school of philosophy which
held that their system was certain; and how on this ground
he distinguishes it from the New Academy,<a name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> which began with
Polemo's successor Arcesilaus, and held that all things are uncertain;
and how he seeks to establish that the Old Academy
was as free from error as from doubt,&mdash;all this, I say, were too
long to enter upon in detail, and yet I must not altogether
pass it by in silence. Varro then rejects, as a first step, all
those differences which have multiplied the number of sects;
and the ground on which he does so is that they are not differences
about the supreme good. He maintains that in
philosophy a sect is created only by its having an opinion of
its own different from other schools on the point of the ends-in-chief.
For man has no other reason for philosophizing
than that he may be happy; but that which makes him happy
is itself the supreme good. In other words, the supreme good
is the reason of philosophizing; and therefore that cannot be
called a sect of philosophy which pursues no way of its own
towards the supreme good. Thus, when it is asked whether a
wise man will adopt the social life, and desire and be interested
in the supreme good of his friend as in his own, or
will, on the contrary, do all that he does merely for his own
sake, there is no question here about the supreme good, but
only about the propriety of associating or not associating a
friend in its participation: whether the wise man will do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
not for his own sake, but for the sake of his friend in whose
good he delights as in his own. So, too, when it is asked
whether all things about which philosophy is concerned are
to be considered uncertain, as by the New Academy, or certain,
as the other philosophers maintain, the question here is
not what end should be pursued, but whether or not we are to
believe in the substantial existence of that end; or, to put it
more plainly, whether he who pursues the supreme good must
maintain that it is a true good, or only that it appears to him
to be true, though possibly it may be delusive,&mdash;both pursuing
one and the same good. The distinction, too, which is founded
on the dress and manners of the Cynics, does not touch the
question of the chief good, but only the question whether he
who pursues that good which seems to himself true should
live as do the Cynics. There were, in fact, men who, though
they pursued different things as the supreme good, some
choosing pleasure, others virtue, yet adopted that mode of life
which gave the Cynics their name. Thus, whatever it is
which distinguishes the Cynics from other philosophers, this
has no bearing on the choice and pursuit of that good which
constitutes happiness. For if it had any such bearing, then
the same habits of life would necessitate the pursuit of the
same chief good, and diverse habits would necessitate the pursuit
of different ends.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>2. <i>How Varro, by removing all the differences which do not form sects, but are
merely secondary questions, reaches three definitions of the chief good, of
which we must choose one.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The same may be said of those three kinds of life, the life
of studious leisure and search after truth, the life of easy
engagement in affairs, and the life in which both these are
mingled. When it is asked, which of these should be adopted,
this involves no controversy about the end of good, but inquires
which of these three puts a man in the best position for finding
and retaining the supreme good. For this good, as soon as
a man finds it, makes him happy; but lettered leisure, or public
business, or the alternation of these, do not necessarily constitute
happiness. Many, in fact, find it possible to adopt one
or other of these modes of life, and yet to miss what makes a
man happy. The question, therefore, regarding the supreme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
good and the supreme evil, and which distinguishes sects of
philosophy, is one; and these questions concerning the social
life, the doubt of the Academy, the dress and food of the
Cynics, the three modes of life&mdash;the active, the contemplative,
and the mixed&mdash;these are different questions, into none of
which the question of the chief good enters. And therefore,
as Marcus Varro multiplied the sects to the number of 288
(or whatever larger number he chose) by introducing these
four differences derived from the social life, the New Academy,
the Cynics, and the threefold form of life, so, by removing
these differences as having no bearing on the supreme good,
and as therefore not constituting what can properly be called
sects, he returns to those twelve schools which concern themselves
with inquiring what that good is which makes man
happy, and he shows that one of these is true, the rest false.
In other words, he dismisses the distinction founded on the
threefold mode of life, and so decreases the whole number by
two-thirds, reducing the sects to ninety-six. Then, putting
aside the Cynic peculiarities, the number decreases by a half,
to forty-eight. Taking away next the distinction occasioned
by the hesitancy of the New Academy, the number is again
halved, and reduced to twenty-four. Treating in a similar
way the diversity introduced by the consideration of the
social life, there are left but twelve, which this difference had
doubled to twenty-four. Regarding these twelve, no reason
can be assigned why they should not be called sects. For in
them the sole inquiry is regarding the supreme good and the
ultimate evil,&mdash;that is to say, regarding the supreme good, for
this being found, the opposite evil is thereby found. Now, to
make these twelve sects, he multiplies by three these four
things&mdash;pleasure, repose, pleasure and repose combined, and the
primary objects of nature which Varro calls <i>primigenia</i>. For
as these four things are sometimes subordinated to virtue, so
that they seem to be desired not for their own sake, but for
virtue's sake; sometimes preferred to it, so that virtue seems
to be necessary not on its own account, but in order to attain
these things; sometimes joined with it, so that both they and
virtue are desired for their own sakes,&mdash;we must multiply the
four by three, and thus we get twelve sects. But from those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
four things Varro eliminates three&mdash;pleasure, repose, pleasure
and repose combined&mdash;not because he thinks these are not
worthy of the place assigned them, but because they are
included in the primary objects of nature. And what need
is there, at any rate, to make a threefold division out of these
two ends, pleasure and repose, taking them first severally and
then conjunctly, since both they, and many other things besides,
are comprehended in the primary objects of nature? Which
of the three remaining sects must be chosen? This is the
question that Varro dwells upon. For whether one of these
three or some other be chosen, reason forbids that more than
one be true. This we shall afterwards see; but meanwhile
let us explain as briefly and distinctly as we can how Varro
makes his selection from these three, that is, from the sects
which severally hold that the primary objects of nature are to
be desired for virtue's sake, that virtue is to be desired for
their sake, and that virtue and these objects are to be desired
each for their own sake.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>3. <i>Which of the three leading opinions regarding the chief good should be preferred,
according to Varro, who follows Antiochus and the Old Academy.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Which of these three is true and to be adopted he attempts
to show in the following manner. As it is the supreme
good, not of a tree, or of a beast, or of a god, but of man,
that philosophy is in quest of, he thinks that, first of all,
we must define man. He is of opinion that there are two
parts in human nature, body and soul, and makes no doubt
that of these two the soul is the better and by far the more
worthy part. But whether the soul alone is the man, so that
the body holds the same relation to it as a horse to the
horseman, this he thinks has to be ascertained. The horseman
is not a horse and a man, but only a man, yet he is
called a horseman, because he is in some relation to the horse.
Again, is the body alone the man, having a relation to the
soul such as the cup has to the drink? For it is not the cup
and the drink it contains which are called the cup, but the
cup alone; yet it is so called because it is made to hold the
drink. Or, lastly, is it neither the soul alone nor the body
alone, but both together, which are man, the body and the soul
being each a part, but the whole man being both together, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
we call two horses yoked together a pair, of which pair the
near and the off horse is each a part, but we do not call either
of them, no matter how connected with the other, a pair, but
only both together? Of these three alternatives, then, Varro
chooses the third, that man is neither the body alone, nor the
soul alone, but both together. And therefore the highest good,
in which lies the happiness of man, is composed of goods
of both kinds, both bodily and spiritual. And consequently
he thinks that the primary objects of nature are to be sought
for their own sake, and that virtue, which is the art of living,
and can be communicated by instruction, is the most excellent
of spiritual goods. This virtue, then, or art of regulating life,
when it has received these primary objects of nature which
existed independently of it, and prior to any instruction,
seeks them all, and itself also, for its own sake; and it uses
them, as it also uses itself, that from them all it may derive
profit and enjoyment, greater or less, according as they are
themselves greater or less; and while it takes pleasure in all
of them, it despises the less that it may obtain or retain the
greater when occasion demands. Now, of all goods, spiritual
or bodily, there is none at all to compare with virtue. For
virtue makes a good use both of itself and of all other goods
in which lies man's happiness; and where it is absent, no
matter how many good things a man has, they are not for his
good, and consequently should not be called good things while
they belong to one who makes them useless by using them
badly. The life of man, then, is called happy when it enjoys
virtue and these other spiritual and bodily good things without
which virtue is impossible. It is called happier if it enjoys
some or many other good things which are not essential to
virtue; and happiest of all, if it lacks not one of the good
things which pertain to the body and the soul. For life is
not the same thing as virtue, since not every life, but a wisely
regulated life, is virtue; and yet, while there can be life of
some kind without virtue, there cannot be virtue without life.
This I might apply to memory and reason, and such mental
faculties; for these exist prior to instruction, and without them
there cannot be any instruction, and consequently no virtue,
since virtue is learned. But bodily advantages, such as swiftness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
of foot, beauty, or strength, are not essential to virtue,
neither is virtue essential to them, and yet they are good
things; and, according to our philosophers, even these advantages
are desired by virtue for its own sake, and are used and
enjoyed by it in a becoming manner.</p>

<p>They say that this happy life is also social, and loves the
advantages of its friends as its own, and for their sake wishes
for them what it desires for itself, whether these friends live
in the same family, as a wife, children, domestics; or in the
locality where one's home is, as the citizens of the same town;
or in the world at large, as the nations bound in common human
brotherhood; or in the universe itself, comprehended in the
heavens and the earth, as those whom they call gods, and
provide as friends for the wise man, and whom we more
familiarly call angels. Moreover, they say that, regarding the
supreme good and evil, there is no room for doubt, and that
they therefore differ from the New Academy in this respect,
and they are not concerned whether a philosopher pursues
those ends which they think true in the Cynic dress and
manner of life or in some other. And, lastly, in regard to
the three modes of life, the contemplative, the active, and the
composite, they declare in favour of the third. That these
were the opinions and doctrines of the Old Academy, Varro
asserts on the authority of Antiochus, Cicero's master and his
own, though Cicero makes him out to have been more frequently
in accordance with the Stoics than with the Old Academy.
But of what importance is this to us, who ought to judge the
matter on its own merits, rather than to understand accurately
what different men have thought about it?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>4. <i>What the Christians believe regarding the supreme good and evil, in opposition
to the philosophers, who have maintained that the supreme good is in
themselves.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>If, then, we be asked what the city of God has to say
upon these points, and, in the first place, what its opinion
regarding the supreme good and evil is, it will reply that life
eternal is the supreme good, death eternal the supreme evil,
and that to obtain the one and escape the other we must live
rightly. And thus it is written, "The just lives by faith,"<a name="FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
we do not as yet see our good, and must therefore live by
faith; neither have we in ourselves power to live rightly, but
can do so only if He who has given us faith to believe in His
help do help us when we believe and pray. As for those who
have supposed that the sovereign good and evil are to be
found in this life, and have placed it either in the soul or the
body, or in both, or, to speak more explicitly, either in pleasure
or in virtue, or in both; in repose or in virtue, or in
both; in pleasure and repose, or in virtue, or in all combined;
in the primary objects of nature, or in virtue, or in both,&mdash;all
these have, with a marvellous shallowness, sought to find their
blessedness in this life and in themselves. Contempt has
been poured upon such ideas by the Truth, saying by the prophet,
"The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men" (or, as the
Apostle Paul cites the passage, "The Lord knoweth the
thoughts of the <i>wise</i>") "that they are vain."<a name="FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<p>For what flood of eloquence can suffice to detail the miseries
of this life? Cicero, in the <i>Consolation</i> on the death of his
daughter, has spent all his ability in lamentation; but how
inadequate was even his ability here? For when, where,
how, in this life can these primary objects of nature be possessed
so that they may not be assailed by unforeseen accidents?
Is the body of the wise man exempt from any pain
which may dispel pleasure, from any disquietude which may
banish repose? The amputation or decay of the members of
the body puts an end to its integrity, deformity blights its
beauty, weakness its health, lassitude its vigour, sleepiness or
sluggishness its activity,&mdash;and which of these is it that may
not assail the flesh of the wise man? Comely and fitting attitudes
and movements of the body are numbered among the
prime natural blessings; but what if some sickness makes the
members tremble? what if a man suffers from curvature of
the spine to such an extent that his hands reach the ground,
and he goes upon all-fours like a quadruped? Does not this
destroy all beauty and grace in the body, whether at rest or in
motion? What shall I say of the fundamental blessings of
the soul, sense and intellect, of which the one is given for the
perception, and the other for the comprehension of truth?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
But what kind of sense is it that remains when a man becomes
deaf and blind? where are reason and intellect when
disease makes a man delirious? We can scarcely, or not at
all, refrain from tears, when we think of or see the actions and
words of such frantic persons, and consider how different from
and even opposed to their own sober judgment and ordinary
conduct their present demeanour is. And what shall I say of
those who suffer from demoniacal possession? Where is their
own intelligence hidden and buried while the malignant spirit
is using their body and soul according to his own will? And
who is quite sure that no such thing can happen to the wise
man in this life? Then, as to the perception of truth, what
can we hope for even in this way while in the body, as we read
in the true book of Wisdom, "The corruptible body weigheth
down the soul, and the earthly tabernacle presseth down the
mind that museth upon many things?"<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id="FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class="fnanchor">[625]</a> And eagerness,
or desire of action, if this is the right meaning to put upon
the Greek &#8001;&#961;&#956;&#8053;, is also reckoned among the primary advantages
of nature; and yet is it not this which produces those
pitiable movements of the insane, and those actions which we
shudder to see, when sense is deceived and reason deranged?</p>

<p>In fine, virtue itself, which is not among the primary objects
of nature, but succeeds to them as the result of learning, though
it holds the highest place among human good things, what is
its occupation save to wage perpetual war with vices,&mdash;not
those that are outside of us, but within; not other men's, but
our own,&mdash;a war which is waged especially by that virtue
which the Greeks call &#963;&#969;&#966;&#961;&#959;&#963;&#8059;&#957;&#951;, and we temperance,<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_626" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> and
which bridles carnal lusts, and prevents them from winning
the consent of the spirit to wicked deeds? For we must not
fancy that there is no vice in us, when, as the apostle says,
"The flesh lusteth against the spirit;"<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id="FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> for to this vice there is
a contrary virtue, when, as the same writer says, "The spirit
lusteth against the flesh." "For these two," he says, "are contrary
one to the other, so that you cannot do the things which
you would." But what is it we wish to do when we seek to
attain the supreme good, unless that the flesh should cease
to lust against the spirit, and that there be no vice in us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
against which the spirit may lust? And as we cannot attain
to this in the present life, however ardently we desire it,
let us by God's help accomplish at least this, to preserve the
soul from succumbing and yielding to the flesh that lusts
against it, and to refuse our consent to the perpetration of
sin. Far be it from us, then, to fancy that while we are still
engaged in this intestine war, we have already found the
happiness which we seek to reach by victory. And who is
there so wise that he has no conflict at all to maintain against
his vices?</p>

<p>What shall I say of that virtue which is called prudence?
Is not all its vigilance spent in the discernment of good from
evil things, so that no mistake may be admitted about what
we should desire and what avoid? And thus it is itself a
proof that we are in the midst of evils, or that evils are in us;
for it teaches us that it is an evil to consent to sin, and a
good to refuse this consent. And yet this evil, to which prudence
teaches and temperance enables us not to consent, is
removed from this life neither by prudence nor by temperance.
And justice, whose office it is to render to every man
his due, whereby there is in man himself a certain just order
of nature, so that the soul is subjected to God, and the flesh
to the soul, and consequently both soul and flesh to God,&mdash;does
not this virtue demonstrate that it is as yet rather labouring
towards its end than resting in its finished work? For
the soul is so much the less subjected to God as it is less
occupied with the thought of God; and the flesh is so much the
less subjected to the spirit as it lusts more vehemently against
the spirit. So long, therefore, as we are beset by this weakness,
this plague, this disease, how shall we dare to say that we are
safe? and if not safe, then how can we be already enjoying
our final beatitude? Then that virtue which goes by the
name of fortitude is the plainest proof of the ills of life, for
it is these ills which it is compelled to bear patiently. And
this holds good, no matter though the ripest wisdom co-exists
with it. And I am at a loss to understand how the Stoic
philosophers can presume to say that these are no ills, though
at the same time they allow the wise man to commit suicide
and pass out of this life if they become so grievous that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
cannot or ought not to endure them. But such is the stupid
pride of these men who fancy that the supreme good can be
found in this life, and that they can become happy by their
own resources, that their wise man, or at least the man whom
they fancifully depict as such, is always happy, even though
he become blind, deaf, dumb, mutilated, racked with pains,
or suffer any conceivable calamity such as may compel him to
make away with himself; and they are not ashamed to call
the life that is beset with these evils happy. O happy life,
which seeks the aid of death to end it! If it is happy, let the
wise man remain in it; but if these ills drive him out of
it, in what sense is it happy? Or how can they say that
these are not evils which conquer the virtue of fortitude, and
force it not only to yield, but so to rave that it in one
breath calls life happy and recommends it to be given up?
For who is so blind as not to see that if it were happy it
would not be fled from? And if they say we should flee
from it on account of the infirmities that beset it, why then
do they not lower their pride and acknowledge that it is
miserable? Was it, I would ask, fortitude or weakness which
prompted Cato to kill himself? for he would not have done
so had he not been too weak to endure C√¶sar's victory.
Where, then, is his fortitude? It has yielded, it has succumbed,
it has been so thoroughly overcome as to abandon,
forsake, flee this happy life. Or was it no longer happy?
Then it was miserable. How, then, were these not evils
which made life miserable, and a thing to be escaped from?</p>

<p>And therefore those who admit that these are evils, as the
Peripatetics do, and the Old Academy, the sect which Varro
advocates, express a more intelligible doctrine; but theirs
also is a surprising mistake, for they contend that this is a
happy life which is beset by these evils, even though they be
so great that he who endures them should commit suicide to
escape them. "Pains and anguish of body," says Varro, "are
evils, and so much the worse in proportion to their severity;
and to escape them you must quit this life." What life, I
pray? This life, he says, which is oppressed by such evils.
Then it is happy in the midst of these very evils on account
of which you say we must quit it? Or do you call it happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
because you are at liberty to escape these evils by death?
What, then, if by some secret judgment of God you were
held fast and not permitted to die, nor suffered to live without
these evils? In that case, at least, you would say that
such a life was miserable. It is soon relinquished, no doubt,
but this does not make it not miserable; for were it eternal,
you yourself would pronounce it miserable. Its brevity,
therefore, does not clear it of misery; neither ought it to be
called happiness because it is a brief misery. Certainly there
is a mighty force in these evils which compel a man&mdash;according
to them, even a wise man&mdash;to cease to be a man that he
may escape them, though they say, and say truly, that it is
as it were the first and strongest demand of nature that a
man cherish himself, and naturally therefore avoid death, and
should so stand his own friend as to wish and vehemently
aim at continuing to exist as a living creature, and subsisting
in this union of soul and body. There is a mighty force in
these evils to overcome this natural instinct by which death
is by every means and with all a man's efforts avoided, and
to overcome it so completely that what was avoided is desired,
sought after, and if it cannot in any other way be obtained,
is inflicted by the man on himself. There is a mighty force
in these evils which make fortitude a homicide,&mdash;if, indeed,
that is to be called fortitude which is so thoroughly overcome
by these evils, that it not only cannot preserve by patience
the man whom it undertook to govern and defend, but is
itself obliged to kill him. The wise man, I admit, ought to
bear death with patience, but when it is inflicted by another.
If, then, as these men maintain, he is obliged to inflict it on
himself, certainly it must be owned that the ills which compel
him to this are not only evils, but intolerable evils. The
life, then, which is either subject to accidents, or environed
with evils so considerable and grievous, could never have been
called happy, if the men who give it this name had condescended
to yield to the truth, and to be conquered by valid
arguments, when they inquired after the happy life, as they
yield to unhappiness, and are overcome by overwhelming
evils, when they put themselves to death, and if they had not
fancied that the supreme good was to be found in this mortal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
life; for the very virtues of this life, which are certainly its
best and most useful possessions, are all the more telling
proofs of its miseries in proportion as they are helpful against
the violence of its dangers, toils, and woes. For if these are
true virtues,&mdash;and such cannot exist save in those who have
true piety,&mdash;they do not profess to be able to deliver the men
who possess them from all miseries; for true virtues tell no
such lies, but they profess that by the hope of the future
world this life, which is miserably involved in the many and
great evils of this world, is happy as it is also safe. For if
not yet safe, how could it be happy? And therefore the
Apostle Paul, speaking not of men without prudence, temperance,
fortitude, and justice, but of those whose lives were
regulated by true piety, and whose virtues were therefore true,
says, "For we are saved by hope: now hope which is seen
is not hope; for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?
But if we hope for that we see not, then do we with patience
wait for it."<a name="FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> As, therefore, we are saved, so we are made
happy by hope. And as we do not as yet possess a present,
but look for a future salvation, so is it with our happiness,
and this "with patience;" for we are encompassed with evils,
which we ought patiently to endure, until we come to the
ineffable enjoyment of unmixed good; for there shall be no
longer anything to endure. Salvation, such as it shall be in
the world to come, shall itself be our final happiness. And
this happiness these philosophers refuse to believe in, because
they do not see it, and attempt to fabricate for themselves a
happiness in this life, based upon a virtue which is as deceitful
as it is proud.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of the social life, which, though most desirable, is frequently disturbed by
many distresses.</i></p>

<p>We give a much more unlimited approval to their idea that
the life of the wise man must be social. For how could the
city of God (concerning which we are already writing no less
than the nineteenth book of this work) either take a beginning
or be developed, or attain its proper destiny, if the life
of the saints were not a social life? But who can enumerate
all the great grievances with which human society abounds in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
the misery of this mortal state? Who can weigh them?
Hear how one of their comic writers makes one of his characters
express the common feelings of all men in this matter:
"I am married; this is one misery. Children are born to me;
they are additional cares."<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id="FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> What shall I say of the miseries
of love which Terence also recounts&mdash;"slights, suspicions,
quarrels, war to-day, peace to-morrow?"<a name="FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">[630]</a> Is not human life
full of such things? Do they not often occur even in
honourable friendships? On all hands we experience these
slights, suspicions, quarrels, war, all of which are undoubted
evils; while, on the other hand, peace is a doubtful good, because
we do not know the heart of our friend, and though
we did know it to-day, we should be as ignorant of what it
might be to-morrow. Who ought to be, or who are more
friendly than those who live in the same family? And yet
who can rely even upon this friendship, seeing that secret
treachery has often broken it up, and produced enmity as bitter
as the amity was sweet, or seemed sweet by the most perfect
dissimulation? It is on this account that the words of Cicero
so move the heart of every one, and provoke a sigh: "There
are no snares more dangerous than those which lurk under
the guise of duty or the name of relationship. For the man
who is your declared foe you can easily baffle by precaution;
but this hidden, intestine, and domestic danger not merely
exists, but overwhelms you before you can foresee and examine
it."<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> It is also to this that allusion is made by the divine
saying, "A man's foes are those of his own household,"<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">[632]</a>&mdash;words
which one cannot hear without pain; for though a man have
sufficient fortitude to endure it with equanimity, and sufficient
sagacity to baffle the malice of a pretended friend, yet if he
himself is a good man, he cannot but be greatly pained at the
discovery of the perfidy of wicked men, whether they have
always been wicked and merely feigned goodness, or have
fallen from a better to a malicious disposition. If, then, home,
the natural refuge from the ills of life, is itself not safe, what
shall we say of the city, which, as it is larger, is so much the
more filled with lawsuits civil and criminal, and is never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
free from the fear, if sometimes from the actual outbreak, of
disturbing and bloody insurrections and civil wars?</p>


<p class="center"><a id="chap6"></a>6. <i>Of the error of human judgments when the truth is hidden.</i></p>

<p>What shall I say of these judgments which men pronounce
on men, and which are necessary in communities, whatever
outward peace they enjoy? Melancholy and lamentable
judgments they are, since the judges are men who cannot
discern the consciences of those at their bar, and are therefore
frequently compelled to put innocent witnesses to the torture
to ascertain the truth regarding the crimes of other men.
What shall I say of torture applied to the accused himself?
He is tortured to discover whether he is guilty, so that, though
innocent, he suffers most undoubted punishment for crime that
is still doubtful, not because it is proved that he committed it,
but because it is not ascertained that he did not commit it.
Thus the ignorance of the judge frequently involves an innocent
person in suffering. And what is still more unendurable&mdash;a
thing, indeed, to be bewailed, and, if that were possible, watered
with fountains of tears&mdash;is this, that when the judge puts the
accused to the question, that he may not unwittingly put an
innocent man to death, the result of this lamentable ignorance
is that this very person, whom he tortured that he might not
condemn him if innocent, is condemned to death both tortured
and innocent. For if he has chosen, in obedience to the
philosophical instructions to the wise man, to quit this life
rather than endure any longer such tortures, he declares that
he has committed the crime which in fact he has not committed.
And when he has been condemned and put to
death, the judge is still in ignorance whether he has put to
death an innocent or a guilty person, though he put the
accused to the torture for the very purpose of saving himself
from condemning the innocent; and consequently he has
both tortured an innocent man to discover his innocence, and
has put him to death without discovering it. If such darkness
shrouds social life, will a wise judge take his seat on
the bench or no? Beyond question he will. For human
society, which he thinks it a wickedness to abandon, constrains
him and compels him to this duty. And he thinks it no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
wickedness that innocent witnesses are tortured regarding the
crimes of which other men are accused; or that the accused
are put to the torture, so that they are often overcome with
anguish, and, though innocent, make false confessions regarding
themselves, and are punished; or that, though they be not
condemned to die, they often die during, or in consequence of,
the torture; or that sometimes the accusers, who perhaps
have been prompted by a desire to benefit society by bringing
criminals to justice, are themselves condemned through the
ignorance of the judge, because they are unable to prove the
truth of their accusations though they are true, and because
the witnesses lie, and the accused endures the torture without
being moved to confession. These numerous and important
evils he does not consider sins; for the wise judge does these
things, not with any intention of doing harm, but because his
ignorance compels him, and because human society claims
him as a judge. But though we therefore acquit the judge
of malice, we must none the less condemn human life as
miserable. And if he is compelled to torture and punish the
innocent because his office and his ignorance constrain him, is
he a happy as well as a guiltless man? Surely it were proof
of more profound considerateness and finer feeling were he to
recognise the misery of these necessities, and shrink from his
own implication in that misery; and had he any piety about
him, he would cry to God, "From my necessities deliver Thou
me."<a name="FNanchor_633_633" id="FNanchor_633_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_633" class="fnanchor">[633]</a></p>


<p class="center">7. <i>Of the diversity of languages, by which the intercourse of men is prevented;
and of the misery of wars, even of those called just.</i></p>

<p>After the state or city comes the world, the third circle of
human society,&mdash;the first being the house, and the second the
city. And the world, as it is larger, so it is fuller of dangers,
as the greater sea is the more dangerous. And here, in the
first place, man is separated from man by the difference of
languages. For if two men, each ignorant of the other's
language, meet, and are not compelled to pass, but, on the
contrary, to remain in company, dumb animals, though of
different species, would more easily hold intercourse than
they, human beings though they be. For their common<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
nature is no help to friendliness when they are prevented by
diversity of language from conveying their sentiments to one
another; so that a man would more readily hold intercourse
with his dog than with a foreigner. But the imperial city
has endeavoured to impose on subject nations not only her
yoke, but her language, as a bond of peace, so that interpreters,
far from being scarce, are numberless. This is true;
but how many great wars, how much slaughter and bloodshed,
have provided this unity! And though these are past, the
end of these miseries has not yet come. For though there
have never been wanting, nor are yet wanting, hostile nations
beyond the empire, against whom wars have been and are
waged, yet, supposing there were no such nations, the very
extent of the empire itself has produced wars of a more obnoxious
description&mdash;social and civil wars&mdash;and with these
the whole race has been agitated, either by the actual conflict
or the fear of a renewed outbreak. If I attempted to give an
adequate description of these manifold disasters, these stern
and lasting necessities, though I am quite unequal to the
task, what limit could I set? But, say they, the wise man
will wage just wars. As if he would not all the rather
lament the necessity of just wars, if he remembers that he is
a man; for if they were not just he would not wage them,
and would therefore be delivered from all wars. For it is the
wrong-doing of the opposing party which compels the wise
man to wage just wars; and this wrong-doing, even though it
gave rise to no war, would still be matter of grief to man because
it is man's wrong-doing. Let every one, then, who
thinks with pain on all these great evils, so horrible, so ruthless,
acknowledge that this is misery. And if any one either
endures or thinks of them without mental pain, this is a more
miserable plight still, for he thinks himself happy because he
has lost human feeling.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>That the friendship of good men cannot be securely rested in, so long as the
dangers of this life force us to be anxious.</i></p>

<p>In our present wretched condition we frequently mistake a
friend for an enemy, and an enemy for a friend. And if we
escape this pitiable blindness, is not the unfeigned confidence
and mutual love of true and good friends our one solace in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
human society, filled as it is with misunderstandings and
calamities? And yet the more friends we have, and the more
widely they are scattered, the more numerous are our fears
that some portion of the vast masses of the disasters of life
may light upon them. For we are not only anxious lest they
suffer from famine, war, disease, captivity, or the inconceivable
horrors of slavery, but we are also affected with the
much more painful dread that their friendship may be
changed into perfidy, malice, and injustice. And when these
contingencies actually occur,&mdash;as they do the more frequently
the more friends we have, and the more widely they are
scattered,&mdash;and when they come to our knowledge, who but
the man who has experienced it can tell with what pangs the
heart is torn? We would, in fact, prefer to hear that they
were dead, although we could not without anguish hear of
even this. For if their life has solaced us with the charms of
friendship, can it be that their death should affect us with no
sadness? He who will have none of this sadness must, if
possible, have no friendly intercourse. Let him interdict or
extinguish friendly affection; let him burst with ruthless insensibility
the bonds of every human relationship; or let him
contrive so to use them that no sweetness shall distil into his
spirit. But if this is utterly impossible, how shall we contrive
to feel no bitterness in the death of those whose life has
been sweet to us? Hence arises that grief which affects the
tender heart like a wound or a bruise, and which is healed by
the application of kindly consolation. For though the cure
is affected all the more easily and rapidly the better condition
the soul is in, we must not on this account suppose that there
is nothing at all to heal. Although, then, our present life is
afflicted, sometimes in a milder, sometimes in a more painful
degree, by the death of those very dear to us, and especially
of useful public men, yet we would prefer to hear that such
men were dead rather than to hear or perceive that they had
fallen from the faith, or from virtue,&mdash;in other words, that
they were spiritually dead. Of this vast material for misery
the earth is full, and therefore it is written, "Is not human
life upon earth a trial?"<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id="FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class="fnanchor">[634]</a> And with the same reference the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>
Lord says, "Woe to the world because of offences!"<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> and
again, "Because iniquity abounded, the love of many shall
wax cold."<a name="FNanchor_636_636" id="FNanchor_636_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_636" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> And hence we enjoy some gratification when
our good friends die; for though their death leaves us in
sorrow, we have the consolatory assurance that they are
beyond the ills by which in this life even the best of men are
broken down or corrupted, or are in danger of both results.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>9. <i>Of the friendship of the holy angels, which men cannot be sure of in this life,
owing to the deceit of the demons who hold in bondage the worshippers of
a plurality of gods.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The philosophers who wished us to have the gods for our
friends rank the friendship of the holy angels in the fourth
circle of society, advancing now from the three circles of
society on earth to the universe, and embracing heaven itself.
And in this friendship we have indeed no fear that the angels
will grieve us by their death or deterioration. But as we
cannot mingle with them as familiarly as with men (which
itself is one of the grievances of this life), and as Satan, as
we read,<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id="FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> sometimes transforms himself into an angel of light,
to tempt those whom it is necessary to discipline, or just to
deceive, there is great need of God's mercy to preserve us
from making friends of demons in disguise, while we fancy
we have good angels for our friends; for the astuteness and
deceitfulness of these wicked spirits is equalled by their hurtfulness.
And is this not a great misery of human life, that
we are involved in such ignorance as, but for God's mercy,
makes us a prey to these demons? And it is very certain
that the philosophers of the godless city, who have maintained
that the gods were their friends, had fallen a prey to
the malignant demons who rule that city, and whose eternal
punishment is to be shared by it. For the nature of these
beings is sufficiently evinced by the sacred or rather sacrilegious
observances which form their worship, and by the
filthy games in which their crimes are celebrated, and which
they themselves originated and exacted from their worshippers
as a fit propitiation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">10. <i>The reward prepared for the saints after they have endured the
trial of this life.</i></p>

<p>But not even the saints and faithful worshippers of the
one true and most high God are safe from the manifold temptations
and deceits of the demons. For in this abode of
weakness, and in these wicked days, this state of anxiety has
also its use, stimulating us to seek with keener longing for
that security where peace is complete and unassailable. There
we shall enjoy the gifts of nature, that is to say, all that God
the Creator of all natures has bestowed upon ours,&mdash;gifts not
only good, but eternal,&mdash;not only of the spirit, healed now by
wisdom, but also of the body renewed by the resurrection.
There the virtues shall no longer be struggling against any
vice or evil, but shall enjoy the reward of victory, the eternal
peace which no adversary shall disturb. This is the final
blessedness, this the ultimate consummation, the unending end.
Here, indeed, we are said to be blessed when we have such
peace as can be enjoyed in a good life; but such blessedness
is mere misery compared to that final felicity. When we
mortals possess such peace as this mortal life can afford,
virtue, if we are living rightly, makes a right use of the advantages
of this peaceful condition; and when we have it not,
virtue makes a good use even of the evils a man suffers.
But this is true virtue, when it refers all the advantages it
makes a good use of, and all that it does in making good use
of good and evil things, and itself also, to that end in which
we shall enjoy the best and greatest peace possible.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of the happiness of the eternal peace, which constitutes the end or true
perfection of the saints.</i></p>

<p>And thus we may say of peace, as we have said of eternal
life, that it is the end of our good; and the rather because
the Psalmist says of the city of God, the subject of this laborious
work, "Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem; praise thy God,
O Zion: for He hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; He
hath blessed thy children within thee; who hath made thy
borders peace."<a name="FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> For when the bars of her gates shall be
strengthened, none shall go in or come out from her; consequently
we ought to understand the peace of her borders as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
that final peace we are wishing to declare. For even the
mystical name of the city itself, that is, <i>Jerusalem</i>, means, as I
have already said, "Vision of Peace." But as the word peace is
employed in connection with things in this world in which
certainly life eternal has no place, we have preferred to call
the end or supreme good of this city life eternal rather than
peace. Of this end the apostle says, "But now, being freed
from sin, and become servants to God, ye have your fruit unto
holiness, and the end life eternal."<a name="FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">[639]</a> But, on the other hand,
as those who are not familiar with Scripture may suppose that
the life of the wicked is eternal life, either because of the
immortality of the soul, which some of the philosophers even
have recognised, or because of the endless punishment of the
wicked, which forms a part of our faith, and which seems
impossible unless the wicked live for ever, it may therefore
be advisable, in order that every one may readily understand
what we mean, to say that the end or supreme good of this
city is either peace in eternal life, or eternal life in peace. For
peace is a good so great, that even in this earthly and mortal
life there is no word we hear with such pleasure, nothing we
desire with such zest, or find to be more thoroughly gratifying.
So that if we dwell for a little longer on this subject,
we shall not, in my opinion, be wearisome to our readers, who
will attend both for the sake of understanding what is the
end of this city of which we speak, and for the sake of the
sweetness of peace which is dear to all.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>That even the fierceness of war and all the disquietude of men make
towards this one end of peace, which every nature desires.</i></p>

<p>Whoever gives even moderate attention to human affairs
and to our common nature, will recognise that if there is
no man who does not wish to be joyful, neither is there
any one who does not wish to have peace. For even they
who make war desire nothing but victory,&mdash;desire, that is
to say, to attain to peace with glory. For what else is victory
than the conquest of those who resist us? and when this is
done there is peace. It is therefore with the desire for peace
that wars are waged, even by those who take pleasure in
exercising their warlike nature in command and battle. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
hence it is obvious that peace is the end sought for by war.
For every man seeks peace by waging war, but no man seeks
war by making peace. For even they who intentionally
interrupt the peace in which they are living have no hatred
of peace, but only wish it changed into a peace that suits
them better. They do not, therefore, wish to have no peace,
but only one more to their mind. And in the case of sedition,
when men have separated themselves from the community,
they yet do not effect what they wish, unless they maintain
some kind of peace with their fellow-conspirators. And
therefore even robbers take care to maintain peace with their
comrades, that they may with greater effect and greater safety
invade the peace of other men. And if an individual happen
to be of such unrivalled strength, and to be so jealous of partnership,
that he trusts himself with no comrades, but makes
his own plots, and commits depredations and murders on his
own account, yet he maintains some shadow of peace with
such persons as he is unable to kill, and from whom he
wishes to conceal his deeds. In his own home, too, he makes
it his aim to be at peace with his wife and children, and any
other members of his household; for unquestionably their
prompt obedience to his every look is a source of pleasure to
him. And if this be not rendered, he is angry, he chides and
punishes; and even by this storm he secures the calm peace
of his own home, as occasion demands. For he sees that
peace cannot be maintained unless all the members of the
same domestic circle be subject to one head, such as he himself
is in his own house. And therefore if a city or nation
offered to submit itself to him, to serve him in the same style
as he had made his household serve him, he would no longer
lurk in a brigand's hiding-places, but lift his head in open
day as a king, though the same covetousness and wickedness
should remain in him. And thus all men desire to have
peace with their own circle whom they wish to govern as
suits themselves. For even those whom they make war
against they wish to make their own, and impose on them
the laws of their own peace.</p>

<p>But let us suppose a man such as poetry and mythology
speak of,&mdash;a man so insociable and savage as to be called rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
a semi-man than a man.<a name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> Although, then, his kingdom was
the solitude of a dreary cave, and he himself was so singularly
bad-hearted that he was named &#922;&#945;&#954;&#8057;&#962;, which is the Greek
word for <i>bad</i>; though he had no wife to soothe him with endearing
talk, no children to play with, no sons to do his bidding, no
friend to enliven him with intercourse, not even his father
Vulcan (though in one respect he was happier than his father,
not having begotten a monster like himself); although he gave
to no man, but took as he wished whatever he could, from
whomsoever he could, when he could; yet in that solitary den,
the floor of which, as Virgil<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id="FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class="fnanchor">[641]</a> says, was always reeking with
recent slaughter, there was nothing else than peace sought, a
peace in which no one should molest him, or disquiet him with
any assault or alarm. With his own body he desired to be at
peace; and he was satisfied only in proportion as he had this
peace. For he ruled his members, and they obeyed him; and
for the sake of pacifying his mortal nature, which rebelled when
it needed anything, and of allaying the sedition of hunger which
threatened to banish the soul from the body, he made forays,
slew, and devoured, but used the ferocity and savageness he
displayed in these actions only for the preservation of his own
life's peace. So that, had he been willing to make with other
men the same peace which he made with himself in his own
cave, he would neither have been called bad, nor a monster,
nor a semi-man. Or if the appearance of his body and his
vomiting smoky fires frightened men from having any dealings
with him, perhaps his fierce ways arose not from a desire to
do mischief, but from the necessity of finding a living. But he
may have had no existence, or, at least, he was not such as the
poets fancifully describe him, for they had to exalt Hercules,
and did so at the expense of Cacus. It is better, then, to
believe that such a man or semi-man never existed, and that
this, in common with many other fancies of the poets, is mere
fiction. For the most savage animals (and he is said to have
been almost a wild beast) encompass their own species with a
ring of protecting peace. They cohabit, beget, produce, suckle,
and bring up their young, though very many of them are not
gregarious, but solitary,&mdash;not like sheep, deer, pigeons, starlings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
bees, but such as lions, foxes, eagles, bats. For what tigress
does not gently purr over her cubs, and lay aside her ferocity
to fondle them? What kite, solitary as he is when circling
over his prey, does not seek a mate, build a nest, hatch the
eggs, bring up the young birds, and maintain with the mother
of his family as peaceful a domestic alliance as he can? How
much more powerfully do the laws of man's nature move him
to hold fellowship and maintain peace with all men so far as
in him lies, since even wicked men wage war to maintain the
peace of their own circle, and wish that, if possible, all men
belonged to them, that all men and things might serve but one
head, and might, either through love or fear, yield themselves
to peace with him! It is thus that pride in its perversity apes
God. It abhors equality with other men under Him; but,
instead of His rule, it seeks to impose a rule of its own upon
its equals. It abhors, that is to say, the just peace of God,
and loves its own unjust peace; but it cannot help loving peace
of one kind or other. For there is no vice so clean contrary
to nature that it obliterates even the faintest traces of nature.</p>

<p>He, then, who prefers what is right to what is wrong, and
what is well-ordered to what is perverted, sees that the peace
of unjust men is not worthy to be called peace in comparison
with the peace of the just. And yet even what is perverted
must of necessity be in harmony with, and in dependence on,
and in some part of the order of things, for otherwise it would
have no existence at all. Suppose a man hangs with his head
downwards, this is certainly a perverted attitude of body and
arrangement of its members; for that which nature requires
to be above is beneath, and <i>vice vers√¢</i>. This perversity disturbs
the peace of the body, and is therefore painful. Nevertheless
the spirit is at peace with its body, and labours for its preservation,
and hence the suffering; but if it is banished from the
body by its pains, then, so long as the bodily framework holds
together, there is in the remains a kind of peace among the
members, and hence the body remains suspended. And inasmuch
as the earthy body tends towards the earth, and rests on
the bond by which it is suspended, it tends thus to its natural
peace, and the voice of its own weight demands a place for it
to rest; and though now lifeless and without feeling, it does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
not fall from the peace that is natural to its place in creation,
whether it already has it, or is tending towards it. For if you
apply embalming preparations to prevent the bodily frame from
mouldering and dissolving, a kind of peace still unites part to
part, and keeps the whole body in a suitable place on the earth,&mdash;in
other words, in a place that is at peace with the body. If,
on the other hand, the body receive no such care, but be left
to the natural course, it is disturbed by exhalations that do not
harmonize with one another, and that offend our senses; for
it is this which is perceived in putrefaction until it is assimilated
to the elements of the world, and particle by particle
enters into peace with them. Yet throughout this process the
laws of the most high Creator and Governor are strictly observed,
for it is by Him the peace of the universe is administered. For
although minute animals are produced from the carcase of a
larger animal, all these little atoms, by the law of the same
Creator, serve the animals they belong to in peace. And although
the flesh of dead animals be eaten by others, no matter where
it be carried, nor what it be brought into contact with, nor what
it be converted and changed into, it still is ruled by the same
laws which pervade all things for the conservation of every
mortal race, and which bring things that fit one another into
harmony.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>13. <i>Of the universal peace which the law of nature preserves through all disturbances,
and by which every one reaches his desert in a way regulated by
the just Judge.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The peace of the body then consists in the duly proportioned
arrangement of its parts. The peace of the irrational soul is
the harmonious repose of the appetites, and that of the rational
soul the harmony of knowledge and action. The peace of body
and soul is the well-ordered and harmonious life and health of
the living creature. Peace between man and God is the well-ordered
obedience of faith to eternal law. Peace between man
and man is well-ordered concord. Domestic peace is the well-ordered
concord between those of the family who rule and
those who obey. Civil peace is a similar concord among the
citizens. The peace of the celestial city is the perfectly ordered
and harmonious enjoyment of God, and of one another in God.
The peace of all things is the tranquillity of order. Order is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
the distribution which allots things equal and unequal, each to
its own place. And hence, though the miserable, in so far as
they are such, do certainly not enjoy peace, but are severed
from that tranquillity of order in which there is no disturbance,
nevertheless, inasmuch as they are deservedly and justly miserable,
they are by their very misery connected with order.
They are not, indeed, conjoined with the blessed, but they are
disjoined from them by the law of order. And though they
are disquieted, their circumstances are notwithstanding adjusted
to them, and consequently they have some tranquillity of order,
and therefore some peace. But they are wretched because,
although not wholly miserable, they are not in that place where
any mixture of misery is impossible. They would, however,
be more wretched if they had not that peace which arises from
being in harmony with the natural order of things. When
they suffer, their peace is in so far disturbed; but their peace
continues in so far as they do not suffer, and in so far as their
nature continues to exist. As, then, there may be life without
pain, while there cannot be pain without some kind of life,
so there may be peace without war, but there cannot be war
without some kind of peace, because war supposes the existence
of some natures to wage it, and these natures cannot
exist without peace of one kind or other.</p>

<p>And therefore there is a nature in which evil does not or
even cannot exist; but there cannot be a nature in which
there is no good. Hence not even the nature of the devil
himself is evil, in so far as it is nature, but it was made evil
by being perverted. Thus he did not abide in the truth,<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> but
could not escape the judgment of the Truth; he did not abide
in the tranquillity of order, but did not therefore escape the
power of the Ordainer. The good imparted by God to his
nature did not screen him from the justice of God by which
order was preserved in his punishment; neither did God
punish the good which He had created, but the evil which
the devil had committed. God did not take back all He had
imparted to his nature, but something He took and something
He left, that there might remain enough to be sensible of the
loss of what was taken. And this very sensibility to pain is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
evidence of the good which has been taken away and the
good which has been left. For, were nothing good left, there
could be no pain on account of the good which had been lost.
For he who sins is still worse if he rejoices in his loss of
righteousness. But he who is in pain, if he derives no benefit
from it, mourns at least the loss of health. And as righteousness
and health are both good things, and as the loss of any
good thing is matter of grief, not of joy,&mdash;if, at least, there is
no compensation, as spiritual righteousness may compensate
for the loss of bodily health,&mdash;certainly it is more suitable
for a wicked man to grieve in punishment than to rejoice in
his fault. As, then, the joy of a sinner who has abandoned
what is good is evidence of a bad will, so his grief for the
good he has lost when he is punished is evidence of a good
nature. For he who laments the peace his nature has lost is
stirred to do so by some relics of peace which make his nature
friendly to itself. And it is very just that in the final
punishment the wicked and godless should in anguish bewail
the loss of the natural advantages they enjoyed, and should
perceive that they were most justly taken from them by that
God whose benign liberality they had despised. God, then,
the most wise Creator and most just Ordainer of all natures,
who placed the human race upon earth as its greatest ornament,
imparted to men some good things adapted to this life,
to wit, temporal peace, such as we can enjoy in this life from
health and safety and human fellowship, and all things needful
for the preservation and recovery of this peace, such as
the objects which are accommodated to our outward senses,
light, night, the air, and waters suitable for us, and everything
the body requires to sustain, shelter, heal, or beautify
it: and all under this most equitable condition, that every
man who made a good use of these advantages suited to the
peace of this mortal condition, should receive ampler and
better blessings, namely, the peace of immortality, accompanied
by glory and honour in an endless life made fit for the enjoyment
of God and of one another in God; but that he who
used the present blessings badly should both lose them and
should not receive the others.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">14. <i>Of the order and law which obtain in heaven and earth, whereby it comes to
pass that human society is served by those who rule it.</i></p>

<p>The whole use, then, of things temporal has a reference to
this result of earthly peace in the earthly community, while
in the city of God it is connected with eternal peace. And
therefore, if we were irrational animals, we should desire
nothing beyond the proper arrangement of the parts of the
body and the satisfaction of the appetites,&mdash;nothing, therefore,
but bodily comfort and abundance of pleasures, that the
peace of the body might contribute to the peace of the soul.
For if bodily peace be awanting, a bar is put to the peace
even of the irrational soul, since it cannot obtain the gratification
of its appetites. And these two together help out the
mutual peace of soul and body, the peace of harmonious life
and health. For as animals, by shunning pain, show that they
love bodily peace, and, by pursuing pleasure to gratify their
appetites, show that they love peace of soul, so their shrinking
from death is a sufficient indication of their intense love of
that peace which binds soul and body in close alliance. But,
as man has a rational soul, he subordinates all this which he
has in common with the beasts to the peace of his rational
soul, that his intellect may have free play and may regulate
his actions, and that he may thus enjoy the well-ordered harmony
of knowledge and action which constitutes, as we have
said, the peace of the rational soul. And for this purpose he
must desire to be neither molested by pain, nor disturbed by
desire, nor extinguished by death, that he may arrive at some
useful knowledge by which he may regulate his life and
manners. But, owing to the liability of the human mind to
fall into mistakes, this very pursuit of knowledge may be a
snare to him unless he has a divine Master, whom he may
obey without misgiving, and who may at the same time give
him such help as to preserve his own freedom. And because,
so long as he is in this mortal body, he is a stranger to God,
he walks by faith, not by sight; and he therefore refers all
peace, bodily or spiritual or both, to that peace which mortal
man has with the immortal God, so that he exhibits the well-ordered
obedience of faith to eternal law. But as this divine
Master inculcates two precepts,&mdash;the love of God and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
love of our neighbour,&mdash;and as in these precepts a man finds
three things he has to love,&mdash;God, himself, and his neighbour,&mdash;and
that he who loves God loves himself thereby, it follows
that he must endeavour to get his neighbour to love God,
since he is ordered to love his neighbour as himself. He
ought to make this endeavour in behalf of his wife, his children,
his household, all within his reach, even as he would
wish his neighbour to do the same for him if he needed it;
and consequently he will be at peace, or in well-ordered concord,
with all men, as far as in him lies. And this is the
order of this concord, that a man, in the first place, injure no
one, and, in the second, do good to every one he can reach.
Primarily, therefore, his own household are his care, for the
law of nature and of society gives him readier access to them
and greater opportunity of serving them. And hence the
apostle says, "Now, if any provide not for his own, and
specially for those of his own house, he hath denied the
faith, and is worse than an infidel."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">[643]</a> This is the origin of
domestic peace, or the well-ordered concord of those in the
family who rule and those who obey. For they who care
for the rest rule,&mdash;the husband the wife, the parents the
children, the masters the servants; and they who are cared
for obey,&mdash;the women their husbands, the children their
parents, the servants their masters. But in the family of
the just man who lives by faith and is as yet a pilgrim
journeying on to the celestial city, even those who rule
serve those whom they seem to command; for they rule
not from a love of power, but from a sense of the duty they
owe to others&mdash;not because they are proud of authority, but
because they love mercy.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>15. <i>Of the liberty proper to man's nature, and the servitude introduced by sin,&mdash;a
servitude in which the man whose will is wicked is the slave of his own
lust, though he is free so far as regards other men.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>This is prescribed by the order of nature: it is thus that
God has created man. For "let them," He says, "have
dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the
air, and over every creeping thing which creepeth on the
earth."<a name="FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> He did not intend that His rational creature, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
was made in His image, should have dominion over anything
but the irrational creation,&mdash;not man over man, but man over
the beasts. And hence the righteous men in primitive times
were made shepherds of cattle rather than kings of men, God
intending thus to teach us what the relative position of the
creatures is, and what the desert of sin; for it is with justice,
we believe, that the condition of slavery is the result of sin.
And this is why we do not find the word "slave" in any part
of Scripture until righteous Noah branded the sin of his son
with this name. It is a name, therefore, introduced by sin
and not by nature. The origin of the Latin word for slave
is supposed to be found in the circumstance that those who
by the law of war were liable to be killed were sometimes
preserved by their victors, and were hence called servants.<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id="FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class="fnanchor">[645]</a>
And these circumstances could never have arisen save through
sin. For even when we wage a just war, our adversaries
must be sinning; and every victory, even though gained by
wicked men, is a result of the first judgment of God, who
humbles the vanquished either for the sake of removing or
of punishing their sins. Witness that man of God, Daniel,
who, when he was in captivity, confessed to God his own sins
and the sins of his people, and declares with pious grief that
these were the cause of the captivity.<a name="FNanchor_646_646" id="FNanchor_646_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_646" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> The prime cause, then,
of slavery is sin, which brings man under the dominion of his
fellow,&mdash;that which does not happen save by the judgment of
God, with whom is no unrighteousness, and who knows how
to award fit punishments to every variety of offence. But our
Master in heaven says, "Every one who doeth sin is the servant
of sin."<a name="FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">[647]</a> And thus there are many wicked masters who
have religious men as their slaves, and who are yet themselves
in bondage; "for of whom a man is overcome, of the same
is he brought in bondage."<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id="FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> And beyond question it is a
happier thing to be the slave of a man than of a lust; for even
this very lust of ruling, to mention no others, lays waste men's
hearts with the most ruthless dominion. Moreover, when men
are subjected to one another in a peaceful order, the lowly
position does as much good to the servant as the proud position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
does harm to the master. But by nature, as God first
created us, no one is the slave either of man or of sin. This
servitude is, however, penal, and is appointed by that law
which enjoins the preservation of the natural order and forbids
its disturbance; for if nothing had been done in violation
of that law, there would have been nothing to restrain by
penal servitude. And therefore the apostle admonishes slaves
to be subject to their masters, and to serve them heartily
and with good-will, so that, if they cannot be freed by their
masters, they may themselves make their slavery in some sort
free, by serving not in crafty fear, but in faithful love, until
all unrighteousness pass away, and all principality and every
human power be brought to nothing, and God be all in all.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of equitable rule.</i></p>

<p>And therefore, although our righteous fathers<a name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> had slaves,
and administered their domestic affairs so as to distinguish
between the condition of slaves and the heirship of sons in
regard to the blessings of this life, yet in regard to the worship
of God, in whom we hope for eternal blessings, they took
an equally loving oversight of all the members of their household.
And this is so much in accordance with the natural
order, that the head of the household was called <i>paterfamilias</i>;
and this name has been so generally accepted, that even those
whose rule is unrighteous are glad to apply it to themselves.
But those who are true fathers of their households desire and
endeavour that all the members of their household, equally
with their own children, should worship and win God, and
should come to that heavenly home in which the duty of
ruling men is no longer necessary, because the duty of caring
for their everlasting happiness has also ceased; but, until they
reach that home, masters ought to feel their position of authority
a greater burden than servants their service. And if any
member of the family interrupts the domestic peace by disobedience,
he is corrected either by word or blow, or some
kind of just and legitimate punishment, such as society permits,
that he may himself be the better for it, and be readjusted
to the family harmony from which he had dislocated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
himself. For as it is not benevolent to give a man help at
the expense of some greater benefit he might receive, so it is
not innocent to spare a man at the risk of his falling into
graver sin. To be innocent, we must not only do harm to
no man, but also restrain him from sin or punish his sin, so
that either the man himself who is punished may profit by
his experience, or others be warned by his example. Since,
then, the house ought to be the beginning or element of the
city, and every beginning bears reference to some end of its
own kind, and every element to the integrity of the whole of
which it is an element, it follows plainly enough that domestic
peace has a relation to civic peace,&mdash;in other words, that the
well-ordered concord of domestic obedience and domestic rule
has a relation to the well-ordered concord of civic obedience
and civic rule. And therefore it follows, further, that the
father of the family ought to frame his domestic rule in accordance
with the law of the city, so that the household may
be in harmony with the civic order.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>What produces peace, and what discord, between the heavenly and
earthly cities.</i></p>

<p>But the families which do not live by faith seek their
peace in the earthly advantages of this life; while the families
which live by faith look for those eternal blessings which
are promised, and use as pilgrims such advantages of time
and of earth as do not fascinate and divert them from God,
but rather aid them to endure with greater ease, and to keep
down the number of those burdens of the corruptible body
which weigh upon the soul. Thus the things necessary for
this mortal life are used by both kinds of men and families
alike, but each has its own peculiar and widely different aim
in using them. The earthly city, which does not live by faith,
seeks an earthly peace, and the end it proposes, in the well-ordered
concord of civic obedience and rule, is the combination
of men's wills to attain the things which are helpful to
this life. The heavenly city, or rather the part of it which
sojourns on earth and lives by faith, makes use of this peace
only because it must, until this mortal condition which necessitates
it shall pass away. Consequently, so long as it lives
like a captive and a stranger in the earthly city, though it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
has already received the promise of redemption, and the gift
of the Spirit as the earnest of it, it makes no scruple to obey
the laws of the earthly city, whereby the things necessary for
the maintenance of this mortal life are administered; and
thus, as this life is common to both cities, so there is a harmony
between them in regard to what belongs to it. But, as
the earthly city has had some philosophers whose doctrine is
condemned by the divine teaching, and who, being deceived
either by their own conjectures or by demons, supposed that
many gods must be invited to take an interest in human
affairs, and assigned to each a separate function and a separate
department,&mdash;to one the body, to another the soul; and
in the body itself, to one the head, to another the neck, and
each of the other members to one of the gods; and in like
manner, in the soul, to one god the natural capacity was assigned,
to another education, to another anger, to another lust;
and so the various affairs of life were assigned,&mdash;cattle to one,
corn to another, wine to another, oil to another, the woods to
another, money to another, navigation to another, wars and
victories to another, marriages to another, births and fecundity
to another, and other things to other gods: and as the celestial
city, on the other hand, knew that one God only was to
be worshipped, and that to Him alone was due that service
which the Greeks call &#955;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#949;&#8055;&#945;, and which can be given only
to a god, it has come to pass that the two cities could not
have common laws of religion, and that the heavenly city has
been compelled in this matter to dissent, and to become
obnoxious to those who think differently, and to stand the
brunt of their anger and hatred and persecutions, except in so
far as the minds of their enemies have been alarmed by the
multitude of the Christians and quelled by the manifest protection
of God accorded to them. This heavenly city, then,
while it sojourns on earth, calls citizens out of all nations, and
gathers together a society of pilgrims of all languages, not
scrupling about diversities in the manners, laws, and institutions
whereby earthly peace is secured and maintained, but
recognising that, however various these are, they all tend to
one and the same end of earthly peace. It therefore is so far
from rescinding and abolishing these diversities, that it even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
preserves and adopts them, so long only as no hindrance to
the worship of the one supreme and true God is thus introduced.
Even the heavenly city, therefore, while in its state
of pilgrimage, avails itself of the peace of earth, and, so far as
it can without injuring faith and godliness, desires and maintains
a common agreement among men regarding the acquisition
of the necessaries of life, and makes this earthly peace
bear upon the peace of heaven; for this alone can be truly
called and esteemed the peace of the reasonable creatures, consisting
as it does in the perfectly ordered and harmonious enjoyment
of God and of one another in God. When we shall
have reached that peace, this mortal life shall give place
to one that is eternal, and our body shall be no more this
animal body which by its corruption weighs down the soul,
but a spiritual body feeling no want, and in all its members
subjected to the will. In its pilgrim state the heavenly
city possesses this peace by faith; and by this faith it lives
righteously when it refers to the attainment of that peace
every good action towards God and man; for the life of the
city is a social life.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>How different the uncertainty of the New Academy is from the certainty of
the Christian faith.</i></p>

<p>As regards the uncertainty about everything which Varro
alleges to be the differentiating characteristic of the New
Academy, the city of God thoroughly detests such doubt as
madness. Regarding matters which it apprehends by the
mind and reason it has most absolute certainty, although its
knowledge is limited because of the corruptible body pressing
down the mind, for, as the apostle says, "We know in part."<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id="FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class="fnanchor">[650]</a>
It believes also the evidence of the senses which the mind
uses by aid of the body; for [if one who trusts his senses is
sometimes deceived], he is more wretchedly deceived who
fancies he should never trust them. It believes also the
Holy Scriptures, old and new, which we call canonical, and
which are the source of the faith by which the just lives,<a name="FNanchor_651_651" id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> and
by which we walk without doubting whilst we are absent
from the Lord.<a name="FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> So long as this faith remains inviolate and
firm, we may without blame entertain doubts regarding some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>
things which we have neither perceived by sense nor by
reason, and which have not been revealed to us by the
canonical Scriptures, nor come to our knowledge through
witnesses whom it is absurd to disbelieve.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of the dress and habits of the Christian people.</i></p>

<p>It is a matter of no moment in the city of God whether
he who adopts the faith that brings men to God adopts it in
one dress and manner of life or another, so long only as he
lives in conformity with the commandments of God. And
hence, when philosophers themselves become Christians, they
are compelled, indeed, to abandon their erroneous doctrines, but
not their dress and mode of living, which are no obstacle to
religion. So that we make no account of that distinction of
sects which Varro adduced in connection with the Cynic
school, provided always nothing indecent or self-indulgent is
retained. As to these three modes of life, the contemplative,
the active, and the composite, although, so long as a man's
faith is preserved, he may choose any of them without detriment
to his eternal interests, yet he must never overlook the
claims of truth and duty. No man has a right to lead such
a life of contemplation as to forget in his own ease the service
due to his neighbour; nor has any man a right to be so immersed
in active life as to neglect the contemplation of God.
The charm of leisure must not be indolent vacancy of mind,
but the investigation or discovery of truth, that thus every
man may make solid attainments without grudging that others
do the same. And, in active life, it is not the honours or
power of this life we should covet, since all things under the
sun are vanity, but we should aim at using our position and
influence, if these have been honourably attained, for the welfare
of those who are under us, in the way we have already
explained.<a name="FNanchor_653_653" id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> It is to this the apostle refers when he says,
"He that desireth the episcopate desireth a good work."<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> He
wished to show that the episcopate is the title of a work, not
of an honour. It is a Greek word, and signifies that he who
governs, superintends or takes care of those whom he governs:
for &#7952;&#960;&#8055; means <i>over</i>, and &#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957;, <i>to see</i>; therefore <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#949;&#8150;&#957;
means "to oversee."<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id="FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class="fnanchor">[655]</a> So that he who loves to govern rather
than to do good is no bishop. Accordingly no one is prohibited
from the search after truth, for in this leisure may
most laudably be spent; but it is unseemly to covet the high
position requisite for governing the people, even though that
position be held and that government be administered in a
seemly manner. And therefore holy leisure is longed for by
the love of truth; but it is the necessity of love to undertake
requisite business. If no one imposes this burden upon us,
we are free to sift and contemplate truth; but if it be laid
upon us, we are necessitated for love's sake to undertake it.
And yet not even in this case are we obliged wholly to relinquish
the sweets of contemplation; for were these to be
withdrawn, the burden might prove more than we could bear.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>That the saints are in this life blessed in hope.</i></p>

<p>Since, then, the supreme good of the city of God is perfect
and eternal peace, not such as mortals pass into and out of
by birth and death, but the peace of freedom from all evil, in
which the immortals ever abide, who can deny that that
future life is most blessed, or that, in comparison with it, this
life which now we live is most wretched, be it filled with all
blessings of body and soul and external things? And yet, if
any man uses this life with a reference to that other which
he ardently loves and confidently hopes for, he may well be
called even now blessed, though not in reality so much as in
hope. But the actual possession of the happiness of this
life, without the hope of what is beyond, is but a false happiness
and profound misery. For the true blessings of the soul
are not now enjoyed; for that is no true wisdom which does
not direct all its prudent observations, manly actions, virtuous
self-restraint, and just arrangements, to that end in which
God shall be all and all in a secure eternity and perfect
peace.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Whether there ever was a Roman republic answering to the definitions
of Scipio in Cicero's dialogue.</i></p>

<p>This, then, is the place where I should fulfil the promise I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span>
gave in the second book of this work,<a name="FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> and explain, as briefly
and clearly as possible, that if we are to accept the definitions
laid down by Scipio in Cicero's <i>De Republica</i>, there never was
a Roman republic; for he briefly defines a republic as the
weal of the people. And if this definition be true, there
never was a Roman republic, for the people's weal was never
attained among the Romans. For the people, according to
his definition, is an assemblage associated by a common
acknowledgment of right and by a community of interests.
And what he means by a common acknowledgment of right
he explains at large, showing that a republic cannot be administered
without justice. Where, therefore, there is no
true justice there can be no right. For that which is done
by right is justly done, and what is unjustly done cannot be
done by right. For the unjust inventions of men are neither
to be considered nor spoken of as rights; for even they themselves
say that right is that which flows from the fountain of
justice, and deny the definition which is commonly given by
those who misconceive the matter, that right is that which is
useful to the stronger party. Thus, where there is not true
justice there can be no assemblage of men associated by a
common acknowledgment of right, and therefore there can
be no people, as defined by Scipio or Cicero; and if no
people, then no weal of the people, but only of some promiscuous
multitude unworthy of the name of people. Consequently,
if the republic is the weal of the people, and there is
no people if it be not associated by a common acknowledgment
of right, and if there is no right where there is no justice,
then most certainly it follows that there is no republic where
there is no justice. Further, justice is that virtue which
gives every one his due. Where, then, is the justice of man,
when he deserts the true God and yields himself to impure
demons? Is this to give every one his due? Or is he who
keeps back a piece of ground from the purchaser, and gives it
to a man who has no right to it, unjust, while he who keeps
back himself from the God who made him, and serves wicked
spirits, is just?</p>

<p>This same book, <i>De Republica</i>, advocates the cause of justice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span>
against injustice with great force and keenness. The pleading
for injustice against justice was first heard, and it was
asserted that without injustice a republic could neither increase
nor even subsist, for it was laid down as an absolutely
unassailable position that it is unjust for some men to rule
and some to serve; and yet the imperial city to which the
republic belongs cannot rule her provinces without having
recourse to this injustice. It was replied in behalf of justice,
that this ruling of the provinces is just, because servitude may
be advantageous to the provincials, and is so when rightly
administered,&mdash;that is to say, when lawless men are prevented
from doing harm. And further, as they became worse and
worse so long as they were free, they will improve by subjection.
To confirm this reasoning, there is added an eminent
example drawn from nature: for "why," it is asked, "does
God rule man, the soul the body, the reason the passions and
other vicious parts of the soul?" This example leaves no
doubt that, to some, servitude is useful; and, indeed, to serve
God is useful to all. And it is when the soul serves God
that it exercises a right control over the body; and in the
soul itself the reason must be subject to God if it is to govern
as it ought the passions and other vices. Hence, when a
man does not serve God, what justice can we ascribe to him,
since in this case his soul cannot exercise a just control over
the body, nor his reason over his vices? And if there is no
justice in such an individual, certainly there can be none in a
community composed of such persons. Here, therefore, there
is not that common acknowledgment of right which makes
an assemblage of men a people whose affairs we call a republic.
And why need I speak of the advantageousness, the
common participation in which, according to the definition,
makes a people? For although, if you choose to regard the
matter attentively, you will see that there is nothing advantageous
to those who live godlessly, as every one lives who
does not serve God but demons, whose wickedness you may
measure by their desire to receive the worship of men though
they are most impure spirits, yet what I have said of the
common acknowledgment of right is enough to demonstrate
that, according to the above definition, there can be no people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
and therefore no republic, where there is no justice. For if
they assert that in their republic the Romans did not serve
unclean spirits, but good and holy gods, must we therefore
again reply to this evasion, though already we have said
enough, and more than enough, to expose it? He must be
an uncommonly stupid, or a shamelessly contentious person,
who has read through the foregoing books to this point, and
can yet question whether the Romans served wicked and
impure demons. But, not to speak of their character, it is
written in the law of the true God, "He that sacrificeth unto
any god save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">[657]</a>
He, therefore, who uttered so menacing a commandment
decreed that no worship should be given either to
good or bad gods.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Whether the God whom the Christians serve is the true God to whom alone
sacrifice ought to be paid.</i></p>

<p>But it may be replied, Who is this God, or what proof is
there that He alone is worthy to receive sacrifice from the
Romans? One must be very blind to be still asking who
this God is. He is the God whose prophets predicted the
things we see accomplished. He is the God from whom
Abraham received the assurance, "In thy seed shall all nations
be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> That this was fulfilled in Christ, who according
to the flesh sprang from that seed, is recognised, whether
they will or no, even by those who have continued to be the
enemies of this name. He is the God whose divine Spirit
spake by the men whose predictions I cited in the preceding
books, and which are fulfilled in the Church which has extended
over all the world. This is the God whom Varro, the
most learned of the Romans, supposed to be Jupiter, though
he knows not what he says; yet I think it right to note the
circumstance that a man of such learning was unable to suppose
that this God had no existence or was contemptible, but
believed Him to be the same as the supreme God. In fine,
He is the God whom Porphyry, the most learned of the philosophers,
though the bitterest enemy of the Christians, confesses
to be a great God, even according to the oracles of those
whom he esteems gods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span></p>
<p class="center">23. <i>Porphyry's account of the responses given by the oracles of the gods concerning
Christ.</i></p>

<p>For in his book called &#7952;&#954; &#955;&#959;&#947;&#8055;&#969;&#957; &#966;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#959;&#966;&#8055;&#945;&#962;, in which he
collects and comments upon the responses which he pretends
were uttered by the gods concerning divine things, he says&mdash;I
give his own words as they have been translated from the
Greek: "To one who inquired what god he should propitiate
in order to recall his wife from Christianity, Apollo replied in
the following verses." Then the following words are given as
those of Apollo: "You will probably find it easier to write
lasting characters on the water, or lightly fly like a bird
through the air, than to restore right feeling in your impious
wife once she has polluted herself. Let her remain as she
pleases in her foolish deception, and sing false laments to her
dead God, who was condemned by right-minded judges, and
perished ignominiously by a violent death." Then after these
verses of Apollo (which we have given in a Latin version that
does not preserve the metrical form), he goes on to say: "In
these verses Apollo exposed the incurable corruption of the
Christians, saying that the Jews, rather than the Christians,
recognised God." See how he misrepresents Christ, giving
the Jews the preference to the Christians in the recognition of
God. This was his explanation of Apollo's verses, in which
he says that Christ was put to death by right-minded or just
judges,&mdash;in other words, that He deserved to die. I leave the
responsibility of this oracle regarding Christ on the lying interpreter
of Apollo, or on this philosopher who believed it or
possibly himself invented it; as to its agreement with Porphyry's
opinions or with other oracles, we shall in a little
have something to say. In this passage, however, he says
that the Jews, as the interpreters of God, judged justly in
pronouncing Christ to be worthy of the most shameful death.
He should have listened, then, to this God of the Jews to whom
he bears this testimony, when that God says, "He that sacrificeth
to any other god save to the Lord alone shall be utterly destroyed."
But let us come to still plainer expressions, and
hear how great a God Porphyry thinks the God of the Jews
is. Apollo, he says, when asked whether word, <i>i.e.</i> reason, or
law is the better thing, replied in the following verses. Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
he gives the verses of Apollo, from which I select the following
as sufficient: "God, the Generator, and the King prior to
all things, before whom heaven and earth, and the sea, and
the hidden places of hell tremble, and the deities themselves
are afraid, for their law is the Father whom the holy Hebrews
honour." In this oracle of his god Apollo, Porphyry avowed
that the God of the Hebrews is so great that the deities themselves
are afraid before Him. I am surprised, therefore, that
when God said, He that sacrificeth to other gods shall be
utterly destroyed, Porphyry himself was not afraid lest he
should be destroyed for sacrificing to other gods.</p>

<p>This philosopher, however, has also some good to say of
Christ, oblivious, as it were, of that contumely of his of which
we have just been speaking; or as if his gods spoke evil of
Christ only while asleep, and recognised Him to be good, and
gave Him His deserved praise, when they awoke. For, as if
he were about to proclaim some marvellous thing passing
belief, he says, "What we are going to say will certainly take
some by surprise. For the gods have declared that Christ
was very pious, and has become immortal, and that they
cherish his memory: that the Christians, however, are polluted,
contaminated, and involved in error. And many other
such things," he says, "do the gods say against the Christians."
Then he gives specimens of the accusations made, as he says,
by the gods against them, and then goes on: "But to some
who asked Hecate whether Christ were a God, she replied,
You know the condition of the disembodied immortal soul,
and that if it has been severed from wisdom it always errs.
The soul you refer to is that of a man foremost in piety: they
worship it because they mistake the truth." To this so-called
oracular response he adds the following words of his own:
"Of this very pious man, then, Hecate said that the soul, like
the souls of other good men, was after death dowered with immortality,
and that the Christians through ignorance worship
it. And to those who ask why he was condemned to die,
the oracle of the goddess replied, The body, indeed, is always
exposed to torments, but the souls of the pious abide in heaven.
And the soul you inquire about has been the fatal cause of
error to other souls which were not fated to receive the gifts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
of the gods, and to have the knowledge of immortal Jove.
Such souls are therefore hated by the gods; for they who
were fated not to receive the gifts of the gods, and not to
know God, were fated to be involved in error by means of
him you speak of. He himself, however, was good, and
heaven has been opened to him as to other good men. You
are not, then, to speak evil of him, but to pity the folly of
men: and through him men's danger is imminent."</p>

<p>Who is so foolish as not to see that these oracles were
either composed by a clever man with a strong animus against
the Christians, or were uttered as responses by impure demons
with a similar design,&mdash;that is to say, in order that their
praise of Christ may win credence for their vituperation of
Christians; and that thus they may, if possible, close the way
of eternal salvation, which is identical with Christianity?
For they believe that they are by no means counterworking
their own hurtful craft by promoting belief in Christ, so long
as their calumniation of Christians is also accepted; for they
thus secure that even the man who thinks well of Christ declines
to become a Christian, and is therefore not delivered
from their own rule by the Christ he praises. Besides, their
praise of Christ is so contrived that whosoever believes in
Him as thus represented will not be a true Christian but
a Photinian heretic, recognising only the humanity, and not
also the divinity of Christ, and will thus be precluded from
salvation and from deliverance out of the meshes of these
devilish lies. For our part, we are no better pleased with
Hecate's praises of Christ than with Apollo's calumniation of
Him. Apollo says that Christ was put to death by right-minded
judges, implying that He was unrighteous. Hecate
says that He was a most pious man, but no more. The intention
of both is the same, to prevent men from becoming Christians,
because if this be secured, men shall never be rescued
from their power. But it is incumbent on our philosopher, or
rather on those who believe in these pretended oracles against
the Christians, first of all, if they can, to bring Apollo and
Hecate to the same mind regarding Christ, so that either both
may condemn or both praise Him. And even if they succeeded
in this, we for our part would notwithstanding repudiate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
the testimony of demons, whether favourable or adverse to
Christ. But when our adversaries find a god and goddess of
their own at variance about Christ, the one praising, the other
vituperating Him, they can certainly give no credence, if they
have any judgment, to mere men who blaspheme the Christians.</p>

<p>When Porphyry or Hecate praises Christ, and adds that He
gave Himself to the Christians as a fatal gift, that they might
be involved in error, he exposes, as he thinks, the causes of
this error. But before I cite his words to that purpose, I
would ask, If Christ did thus give Himself to the Christians
to involve them in error, did He do so willingly, or against
His will? If willingly, how is He righteous? If against
His will, how is He blessed? However, let us hear the
causes of this error. "There are," he says, "in a certain
place very small earthly spirits, subject to the power of evil
demons. The wise men of the Hebrews, among whom was
this Jesus, as you have heard from the oracles of Apollo cited
above, turned religious persons from these very wicked demons
and minor spirits, and taught them rather to worship the
celestial gods, and especially to adore God the Father. This,"
he said, "the gods enjoin; and we have already shown how
they admonish the soul to turn to God, and command it to
worship Him. But the ignorant and the ungodly, who are
not destined to receive favours from the gods, nor to know the
immortal Jupiter, not listening to the gods and their messages,
have turned away from all gods, and have not only refused to
hate, but have venerated the prohibited demons. Professing
to worship God, they refuse to do those things by which alone
God is worshipped. For God, indeed, being the Father of all,
is in need of nothing; but for us it is good to adore Him by
means of justice, chastity, and other virtues, and thus to make
life itself a prayer to Him, by inquiring into and imitating His
nature. For inquiry," says he, "purifies and imitation deifies
us, by moving us nearer to Him." He is right in so far as
he proclaims God the Father, and the conduct by which we
should worship Him. Of such precepts the prophetic books
of the Hebrews are full, when they praise or blame the life of
the saints. But in speaking of the Christians he is in error,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>
and calumniates them as much as is desired by the demons
whom he takes for gods, as if it were difficult for any man to
recollect the disgraceful and shameful actions which used to
be done in the theatres and temples to please the gods, and
to compare with these things what is heard in our churches,
and what is offered to the true God, and from this comparison
to conclude where character is edified, and where it is ruined.
But who but a diabolical spirit has told or suggested to this
man so manifest and vain a lie, as that the Christians reverenced
rather than hated the demons, whose worship the Hebrews
prohibited? But that God, whom the Hebrew sages worshipped,
forbids sacrifice to be offered even to the holy angels
of heaven and divine powers, whom we, in this our pilgrimage,
venerate and love as our most blessed fellow-citizens. For in
the law which God gave to His Hebrew people He utters
this menace, as in a voice of thunder: "He that sacrificeth
unto any god, save unto the Lord only, he shall be utterly
destroyed."<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> And that no one might suppose that this prohibition
extends only to the very wicked demons and earthly
spirits, whom this philosopher calls very small and inferior,&mdash;for
even these are in the Scripture called gods, not of the
Hebrews, but of the nations, as the Septuagint translators have
shown in the psalm where it is said, "For all the gods of the
nations are demons,"<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id="FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class="fnanchor">[660]</a>&mdash;that no one might suppose, I say, that
sacrifice to these demons was prohibited, but that sacrifice
might be offered to all or some of the celestials, it was immediately
added, "save unto the Lord alone."<a name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_661" class="fnanchor">[661]</a> The God of
the Hebrews, then, to whom this renowned philosopher bears
this signal testimony, gave to His Hebrew people a law,
composed in the Hebrew language, and not obscure and
unknown, but published now in every nation, and in this
law it is written, "He that sacrificeth unto any god, save
unto the Lord alone, he shall be utterly destroyed." What
need is there to seek further proofs in the law or the prophets
of this same thing? <i>Seek</i>, we need not say, for the passages
are neither few nor difficult to find; but what need to collect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>
and apply to my argument the proofs which are thickly sown
and obvious, and by which it appears clear as day that sacrifice
may be paid to none but the supreme and true God? Here
is one brief but decided, even menacing, and certainly true
utterance of that God whom the wisest of our adversaries so
highly extol. Let this be listened to, feared, fulfilled, that
there may be no disobedient soul cut off. "He that sacrifices,"
He says, not because He needs anything, but because it behoves
us to be His possession. Hence the Psalmist in the Hebrew
Scriptures sings, "I have said to the Lord, Thou art my God,
for Thou needest not my good."<a name="FNanchor_662_662" id="FNanchor_662_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_662" class="fnanchor">[662]</a> For we ourselves, who are
His own city, are His most noble and worthy sacrifice, and it
is this mystery we celebrate in our sacrifices, which are well
known to the faithful, as we have explained in the preceding
books. For through the prophets the oracles of God declared
that the sacrifices which the Jews offered as a shadow of that
which was to be would cease, and that the nations, from the
rising to the setting of the sun, would offer one sacrifice.
From these oracles, which we now see accomplished, we have
made such selections as seemed suitable to our purpose in this
work. And therefore, where there is not this righteousness
whereby the one supreme God rules the obedient city according
to His grace, so that it sacrifices to none but Him, and
whereby, in all the citizens of this obedient city, the soul consequently
rules the body and reason the vices in the rightful
order, so that, as the individual just man, so also the community
and people of the just, live by faith, which works by
love, that love whereby man loves God as He ought to be
loved, and his neighbour as himself,&mdash;there, I say, there is
not an assemblage associated by a common acknowledgment
of right, and by a community of interests. But if there is
not this, there is not a people, if our definition be true, and
therefore there is no republic; for where there is no people
there can be no republic.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>24. <i>The definition which must be given of a people and a republic, in order to
vindicate the assumption of these titles by the Romans and by other kingdoms.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But if we discard this definition of a people, and, assuming
another, say that a people is an assemblage of reasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
beings bound together by a common agreement as to the objects
of their love, then, in order to discover the character of any
people, we have only to observe what they love. Yet whatever
it loves, if only it is an assemblage of reasonable beings
and not of beasts, and is bound together by an agreement as
to the objects of love, it is reasonably called a people; and
it will be a superior people in proportion as it is bound together
by higher interests, inferior in proportion as it is bound
together by lower. According to this definition of ours, the
Roman people is a people, and its weal is without doubt a
commonwealth or republic. But what its tastes were in its
early and subsequent days, and how it declined into sanguinary
seditions and then to social and civil wars, and so burst
asunder or rotted off the bond of concord in which the health
of a people consists, history shows, and in the preceding books
I have related at large. And yet I would not on this account
say either that it was not a people, or that its administration
was not a republic, so long as there remains an assemblage of
reasonable beings bound together by a common agreement as
to the objects of love. But what I say of this people and of
this republic I must be understood to think and say of the
Athenians or any Greek state, of the Egyptians, of the early
Assyrian Babylon, and of every other nation, great or small,
which had a public government. For, in general, the city of
the ungodly, which did not obey the command of God that
it should offer no sacrifice save to Him alone, and which,
therefore, could not give to the soul its proper command over
the body, nor to the reason its just authority over the vices,
is void of true justice.</p>


<p class="center">25. <i>That where there is no true religion there are no true virtues.</i></p>

<p>For though the soul may seem to rule the body admirably,
and the reason the vices, if the soul and reason do not themselves
obey God, as God has commanded them to serve Him,
they have no proper authority over the body and the vices. For
what kind of mistress of the body and the vices can that mind
be which is ignorant of the true God, and which, instead of
being subject to His authority, is prostituted to the corrupting
influences of the most vicious demons? It is for this reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
that the virtues which it seems to itself to possess, and by
which it restrains the body and the vices that it may obtain
and keep what it desires, are rather vices than virtues so long
as there is no reference to God in the matter. For although
some suppose that virtues which have a reference only to
themselves, and are desired only on their own account, are
yet true and genuine virtues, the fact is that even then they
are inflated with pride, and are therefore to be reckoned vices
rather than virtues. For as that which gives life to the flesh
is not derived from flesh, but is above it, so that which gives
blessed life to man is not derived from man, but is something
above him; and what I say of man is true of every celestial
power and virtue whatsoever.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>26. <i>Of the peace which is enjoyed by the people that are alienated from God, and
the use made of it by the people of God in the time of its pilgrimage.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Wherefore, as the life of the flesh is the soul, so the blessed
life of man is God, of whom the sacred writings of the Hebrews
say, "Blessed is the people whose God is the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_663_663" id="FNanchor_663_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_663" class="fnanchor">[663]</a> Miserable,
therefore, is the people which is alienated from God. Yet
even this people has a peace of its own which is not to be
lightly esteemed, though, indeed, it shall not in the end enjoy
it, because it makes no good use of it before the end. But it
is our interest that it enjoy this peace meanwhile in this life;
for as long as the two cities are commingled, we also enjoy the
peace of Babylon. For from Babylon the people of God is so
freed that it meanwhile sojourns in its company. And therefore
the apostle also admonished the Church to pray for kings
and those in authority, assigning as the reason, "that we may
live a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and love."<a name="FNanchor_664_664" id="FNanchor_664_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_664" class="fnanchor">[664]</a>
And the prophet Jeremiah, when predicting the captivity that
was to befall the ancient people of God, and giving them the
divine command to go obediently to Babylonia, and thus serve
their God, counselled them also to pray for Babylonia, saying,
"In the peace thereof shall ye have peace,"<a name="FNanchor_665_665" id="FNanchor_665_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_665" class="fnanchor">[665]</a>&mdash;the temporal
peace which the good and the wicked together enjoy.</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>That the peace of those who serve God cannot in this mortal life be
apprehended in its perfection.</i></p>

<p>But the peace which is peculiar to ourselves we enjoy now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>
with God by faith, and shall hereafter enjoy eternally with
Him by sight. But the peace which we enjoy in this life,
whether common to all or peculiar to ourselves, is rather the
solace of our misery than the positive enjoyment of felicity.
Our very righteousness, too, though true in so far as it has
respect to the true good, is yet in this life of such a kind that
it consists rather in the remission of sins than in the perfecting
of virtues. Witness the prayer of the whole city of God
in its pilgrim state, for it cries to God by the mouth of all its
members, "Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors."<a name="FNanchor_666_666" id="FNanchor_666_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_666" class="fnanchor">[666]</a>
And this prayer is efficacious not for those whose faith is
"without works and dead,"<a name="FNanchor_667_667" id="FNanchor_667_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> but for those whose faith "worketh
by love."<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> For as reason, though subjected to God, is yet
"pressed down by the corruptible body,"<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id="FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class="fnanchor">[669]</a> so long as it is in
this mortal condition, it has not perfect authority over vice,
and therefore this prayer is needed by the righteous. For
though it exercises authority, the vices do not submit without
a struggle. For however well one maintains the conflict, and
however thoroughly he has subdued these enemies, there steals
in some evil thing, which, if it do not find ready expression in
act, slips out by the lips, or insinuates itself into the thought;
and therefore his peace is not full so long as he is at war
with his vices. For it is a doubtful conflict he wages with
those that resist, and his victory over those that are defeated
is not secure, but full of anxiety and effort. Amidst these
temptations, therefore, of all which it has been summarily
said in the divine oracles, "Is not human life upon earth a
temptation?"<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id="FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class="fnanchor">[670]</a> who but a proud man can presume that he so
lives that he has no need to say to God, "Forgive us our
debts?" And such a man is not great, but swollen and puffed
up with vanity, and is justly resisted by Him who abundantly
gives grace to the humble. Whence it is said, "God resisteth
the proud, but giveth grace to the humble."<a name="FNanchor_671_671" id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> In this, then,
consists the righteousness of a man, that he submit himself to
God, his body to his soul, and his vices, even when they rebel,
to his reason, which either defeats or at least resists them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
and also that he beg from God grace to do his duty,<a name="FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> and the
pardon of his sins, and that he render to God thanks for all
the blessings he receives. But, in that final peace to which
all our righteousness has reference, and for the sake of which
it is maintained, as our nature shall enjoy a sound immortality
and incorruption, and shall have no more vices, and as we
shall experience no resistance either from ourselves or from
others, it will not be necessary that reason should rule vices
which no longer exist, but God shall rule the man, and the
soul shall rule the body, with a sweetness and facility suitable
to the felicity of a life which is done with bondage. And
this condition shall there be eternal, and we shall be assured
of its eternity; and thus the peace of this blessedness and
the blessedness of this peace shall be the supreme good.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>The end of the wicked.</i></p>

<p>But, on the other hand, they who do not belong to this city
of God shall inherit eternal misery, which is also called the
second death, because the soul shall then be separated from
God its life, and therefore cannot be said to live, and the
body shall be subjected to eternal pains. And consequently
this second death shall be the more severe, because no death
shall terminate it. But war being contrary to peace, as misery
to happiness, and life to death, it is not without reason asked
what kind of war can be found in the end of the wicked
answering to the peace which is declared to be the end of the
righteous? The person who puts this question has only to
observe what it is in war that is hurtful and destructive, and he
shall see that it is nothing else than the mutual opposition and
conflict of things. And can he conceive a more grievous and
bitter war than that in which the will is so opposed to passion,
and passion to the will, that their hostility can never be terminated
by the victory of either, and in which the violence
of pain so conflicts with the nature of the body, that neither
yields to the other? For in this life, when this conflict has
arisen, either pain conquers and death expels the feeling of it,
or nature conquers and health expels the pain. But in the
world to come the pain continues that it may torment, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
the nature endures that it may be sensible of it; and neither
ceases to exist, lest punishment also should cease. Now, as it
is through the last judgment that men pass to these ends,
the good to the supreme good, the evil to the supreme evil,
I will treat of this judgment in the following book.</p>

<h2><a name="BOOK_TWENTIETH" id="BOOK_TWENTIETH">BOOK TWENTIETH.</a></h2>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<p class="center">CONCERNING THE LAST JUDGMENT, AND THE DECLARATIONS REGARDING IT IN
THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS.</p>


<p class="center">1. <i>That although God is always judging, it is nevertheless reasonable to confine
our attention in this book to His last judgment.</i></p>

<p>Intending to speak, in dependence on God's grace, of
the day of His final judgment, and to affirm it against
the ungodly and incredulous, we must first of all lay, as it
were, in the foundation of the edifice the divine declarations.
Those persons who do not believe such declarations do their
best to oppose to them false and illusive sophisms of their
own, either contending that what is adduced from Scripture
has another meaning, or altogether denying that it is an utterance
of God's. For I suppose no man who understands what
is written, and believes it to be communicated by the supreme
and true God through holy men, refuses to yield and consent
to these declarations, whether he orally confesses his consent,
or is from some evil influence ashamed or afraid to do so; or
even, with an opinionativeness closely resembling madness,
makes strenuous efforts to defend what he knows and believes
to be false against what he knows and believes to be true.</p>

<p>That, therefore, which the whole Church of the true God
holds and professes as its creed, that Christ shall come from
heaven to judge quick and dead, this we call the last day, or
last time, of the divine judgment. For we do not know how
many days this judgment may occupy; but no one who reads
the Scriptures, however negligently, need be told that in them
"day" is customarily used for "time." And when we speak
of the day of God's judgment, we add the word last or final
for this reason, because even now God judges, and has judged
from the beginning of human history, banishing from paradise,
and excluding from the tree of life, those first men who perpetrated
so great a sin. Yea, He was certainly exercising<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
judgment also when He did not spare the angels who sinned,
whose prince, overcome by envy, seduced men after being
himself seduced. Neither is it without God's profound and
just judgment that the life of demons and men, the one in
the air, the other on earth, is filled with misery, calamities,
and mistakes. And even though no one had sinned, it could
only have been by the good and right judgment of God that
the whole rational creation could have been maintained in
eternal blessedness by a persevering adherence to its Lord.
He judges, too, not only in the mass, condemning the race of
devils and the race of men to be miserable on account of the
original sin of these races, but He also judges the voluntary
and personal acts of individuals. For even the devils pray
that they may not be tormented,<a name="FNanchor_673_673" id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> which proves that without
injustice they might either be spared or tormented according
to their deserts. And men are punished by God for their
sins often visibly, always secretly, either in this life or after
death, although no man acts rightly save by the assistance of
divine aid; and no man or devil acts unrighteously save by
the permission of the divine and most just judgment. For, as
the apostle says, "There is no unrighteousness with God;"<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id="FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class="fnanchor">[674]</a>
and as he elsewhere says, "His judgments are inscrutable,
and His ways past finding out."<a name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> In this book, then, I shall
speak, as God permits, not of those first judgments, nor of
these intervening judgments of God, but of the last judgment,
when Christ is to come from heaven to judge the quick and
the dead. For that day is properly called the day of judgment,
because in it there shall be no room left for the ignorant
questioning why this wicked person is happy and that
righteous man unhappy. In that day true and full happiness
shall be the lot of none but the good, while deserved and
supreme misery shall be the portion of the wicked, and of
them only.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>That in the mingled web of human affairs God's judgment is present, though
it cannot be discerned.</i></p>

<p>In this present time we learn to bear with equanimity the
ills to which even good men are subject, and to hold cheap
the blessings which even the wicked enjoy. And consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>
even in those conditions of life in which the justice
of God is not apparent, His teaching is salutary. For we do
not know by what judgment of God this good man is poor
and that bad man rich; why he who, in our opinion, ought
to suffer acutely for his abandoned life enjoys himself, while
sorrow pursues him whose praiseworthy life leads us to suppose
he should be happy; why the innocent man is dismissed from
the bar not only unavenged, but even condemned, being either
wronged by the iniquity of the judge, or overwhelmed by
false evidence, while his guilty adversary, on the other hand,
is not only discharged with impunity, but even has his claims
admitted; why the ungodly enjoys good health, while the godly
pines in sickness; why ruffians are of the soundest constitution,
while they who could not hurt any one even with a
word are from infancy afflicted with complicated disorders;
why he who is useful to society is cut off by premature death,
while those who, as it might seem, ought never to have been
so much as born have lives of unusual length; why he who
is full of crimes is crowned with honours, while the blameless
man is buried in the darkness of neglect. But who can collect
or enumerate all the contrasts of this kind? But if this
anomalous state of things were uniform in this life, in which,
as the sacred Psalmist says, "Man is like to vanity, his days
as a shadow that passeth away,"<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id="FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class="fnanchor">[676]</a>&mdash;so uniform that none but
wicked men won the transitory prosperity of earth, while only
the good suffered its ills,&mdash;this could be referred to the just and
even benign judgment of God. We might suppose that they
who were not destined to obtain those everlasting benefits
which constitute human blessedness were either deluded by
transitory blessings as the just reward of their wickedness, or
were, in God's mercy, consoled by them, and that they who
were not destined to suffer eternal torments were afflicted
with temporal chastisement for their sins, or were stimulated to
greater attainment in virtue. But now, as it is, since we not
only see good men involved in the ills of life, and bad men
enjoying the good of it, which seems unjust, but also that evil
often overtakes evil men, and good surprises the good, the
rather on this account are God's judgments unsearchable, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span>
His ways past finding out. Although, therefore, we do not
know by what judgment these things are done or permitted
to be done by God, with whom is the highest virtue, the
highest wisdom, the highest justice, no infirmity, no rashness,
no unrighteousness, yet it is salutary for us to learn to hold
cheap such things, be they good or evil, as attach indifferently
to good men and bad, and to covet those good things
which belong only to good men, and flee those evils which
belong only to evil men. But when we shall have come to
that judgment, the date of which is called peculiarly the day
of judgment, and sometimes the day of the Lord, we shall
then recognise the justice of all God's judgments, not only of
such as shall then be pronounced, but of all which take effect
from the beginning, or may take effect before that time. And
in that day we shall also recognise with what justice so many,
or almost all, the just judgments of God in the present life
defy the scrutiny of human sense or insight, though in this
matter it is not concealed from pious minds that what is concealed
is just.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>What Solomon, in the book of Ecclesiastes, says regarding the things which
happen alike to good and wicked men.</i></p>

<p>Solomon, the wisest king of Israel, who reigned in Jerusalem,
thus commences the book called Ecclesiastes, which
the Jews number among their canonical Scriptures: "Vanity
of vanities, said Ecclesiastes, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
What profit hath a man of all his labour which he hath
taken under the sun?"<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id="FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> And after going on to enumerate,
with this as his text, the calamities and delusions of this
life, and the shifting nature of the present time, in which
there is nothing substantial, nothing lasting, he bewails,
among the other vanities that are under the sun, this also,
that though wisdom excelleth folly as light excelleth darkness,
and though the eyes of the wise man are in his head, while
the fool walketh in darkness,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id="FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> yet one event happeneth to
them all, that is to say, in this life under the sun, unquestionably
alluding to those evils which we see befall good and
bad men alike. He says, further, that the good suffer the ills
of life as if they were evil-doers, and the bad enjoy the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
of life as if they were good. "There is a vanity which is
done upon the earth; that there be just men unto whom it
happeneth according to the work of the wicked: again, there
be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work
of the righteous. I said, that this also is vanity."<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id="FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> This
wisest man devoted this whole book to a full exposure of this
vanity, evidently with no other object than that we might
long for that life in which there is no vanity under the sun,
but verity under Him who made the sun. In this vanity,
then, was it not by the just and righteous judgment of God
that man, made like to vanity, was destined to pass away?
But in these days of vanity it makes an important difference
whether he resists or yields to the truth, and whether he is destitute
of true piety or a partaker of it,&mdash;important not so far as
regards the acquirement of the blessings or the evasion of the
calamities of this transitory and vain life, but in connection
with the future judgment which shall make over to good men
good things, and to bad men bad things, in permanent, inalienable
possession. In fine, this wise man concludes this
book of his by saying, "Fear God, and keep His commandments:
for this is every man. For God shall bring every
work into judgment, with every despised person, whether it
be good, or whether it be evil."<a name="FNanchor_680_680" id="FNanchor_680_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_680" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> What truer, terser, more
salutary enouncement could be made? "Fear God," he says,
"and keep His commandments: for this is every man." For
whosoever has real existence, is this, is a keeper of God's
commandments; and he who is not this, is nothing. For so
long as he remains in the likeness of vanity, he is not renewed
in the image of the truth. "For God shall bring into judgment
every work,"&mdash;that is, whatever man does in this life,&mdash;"whether
it be good or whether it be evil, with every
despised person,"&mdash;that is, with every man who here seems
despicable, and is therefore not considered; for God sees
even him, and does not despise him nor pass him over in His
judgment.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>That proofs of the last judgment will be adduced, first from the New
Testament, and then from the Old.</i></p>

<p>The proofs, then, of this last judgment of God which I propose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
to adduce shall be drawn first from the New Testament,
and then from the Old. For although the Old Testament is
prior in point of time, the New has the precedence in intrinsic
value; for the Old acts the part of herald to the New. We
shall therefore first cite passages from the New Testament,
and confirm them by quotations from the Old Testament.
The Old contains the law and the prophets, the New the gospel
and the apostolic epistles. Now the apostle says, "By the
law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of
God without the law is manifested, being witnessed by the
law and the prophets; now the righteousness of God is by
faith of Jesus Christ upon all them that believe."<a name="FNanchor_681_681" id="FNanchor_681_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_681" class="fnanchor">[681]</a> This
righteousness of God belongs to the New Testament, and
evidence for it exists in the old books, that is to say, in
the law and the prophets. I shall first, then, state the case,
and then call the witnesses. This order Jesus Christ Himself
directs us to observe, saying, "The scribe instructed in the
kingdom of God is like a good householder, bringing out of
his treasure things new and old."<a name="FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> He did not say "old and
new," which He certainly would have said had He not wished
to follow the order of merit rather than that of time.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>The passages in which the Saviour declares that there shall be a divine judgment
in the end of the world.</i></p>

<p>The Saviour Himself, while reproving the cities in which
He had done great works, but which had not believed, and
while setting them in unfavourable comparison with foreign
cities, says, "But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable
for Tyre and Sidon at the day of judgment than for you."<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id="FNanchor_683_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_683" class="fnanchor">[683]</a>
And a little after He says, "Verily, I say unto you, It shall
be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment
than for thee."<a name="FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Here He most plainly predicts that a
day of judgment is to come. And in another place He says,
"The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation,
and shall condemn it: because they repented at the
preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.
The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with
this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
uttermost parts of the earth to hear the words of Solomon;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here."<a name="FNanchor_685_685" id="FNanchor_685_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685_685" class="fnanchor">[685]</a> Two things
we learn from this passage, that a judgment is to take place,
and that it is to take place at the resurrection of the dead.
For when He spoke of the Ninevites and the queen of the
south, He certainly spoke of dead persons, and yet He said
that they should rise up in the day of judgment. He did not
say, "They shall condemn," as if they themselves were to be
the judges, but because, in comparison with them, the others
shall be justly condemned.</p>

<p>Again, in another passage, in which He was speaking of the
present intermingling and future separation of the good and
bad,&mdash;the separation which shall be made in the day of judgment,&mdash;He
adduced a comparison drawn from the sown wheat
and the tares sown among them, and gave this explanation of
it to His disciples: "He that soweth the good seed is the Son
of man,"<a name="FNanchor_686_686" id="FNanchor_686_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686_686" class="fnanchor">[686]</a> etc. Here, indeed, He did not name the judgment
or the day of judgment, but indicated it much more clearly by
describing the circumstances, and foretold that it should take
place in the end of the world.</p>

<p>In like manner He says to His disciples, "Verily I say
unto you, That ye which have followed me, in the regeneration,
when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of His glory, ye
also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes
of Israel."<a name="FNanchor_687_687" id="FNanchor_687_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_687" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> Here we learn that Jesus shall judge with His
disciples. And therefore He said elsewhere to the Jews,
"If I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your sons
cast them out? Therefore they shall be your judges."<a name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
Neither ought we to suppose that only twelve men shall judge
along with Him, though He says that they shall sit upon
twelve thrones, for by the number twelve is signified the
completeness of the multitude of those who shall judge. For
the two parts of the number seven (which commonly symbolizes
totality), that is to say, four and three, multiplied into one
another, give twelve. For four times three, or three times
four, are twelve. There are other meanings, too, in this
number twelve. Were not this the right interpretation of
the twelve thrones, then since we read that Matthias was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>
ordained an apostle in the room of Judas the traitor, the
Apostle Paul, though he laboured more than them all,<a name="FNanchor_689_689" id="FNanchor_689_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_689" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> should
have no throne of judgment; but he unmistakeably considers
himself to be included in the number of the judges when he
says, "Know ye not that we shall judge angels?"<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id="FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class="fnanchor">[690]</a> The same
rule is to be observed in applying the number twelve to those
who are to be judged. For though it was said, "judging the
twelve tribes of Israel," the tribe of Levi, which is the
thirteenth, shall not on this account be exempt from judgment,
neither shall judgment be passed only on Israel and
not on the other nations. And by the words "in the regeneration"
He certainly meant the resurrection of the dead
to be understood; for our flesh shall be regenerated by incorruption,
as our soul is regenerated by faith.</p>

<p>Many passages I omit, because, though they seem to refer
to the last judgment, yet on a closer examination they are
found to be ambiguous, or to allude rather to some other
event,&mdash;whether to that coming of the Saviour which continually
occurs in His Church, that is, in His members, in
which He comes little by little, and piece by piece, since the
whole Church is His body, or to the destruction of the
earthly Jerusalem. For when He speaks even of this, He often
uses language which is applicable to the end of the world and
that last and great day of judgment, so that these two events
cannot be distinguished unless all the corresponding passages
bearing on the subject in the three evangelists, Matthew,
Mark, and Luke, are compared with one another,&mdash;for some
things are put more obscurely by one evangelist and more
plainly by another,&mdash;so that it becomes apparent what things
are meant to be referred to one event. It is this which I
have been at pains to do in a letter which I wrote to Hesychius
of blessed memory, bishop of Salon, and entitled, "Of
the End of the World."<a name="FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p>

<p>I shall now cite from the Gospel according to Matthew the
passage which speaks of the separation of the good from the
wicked by the most efficacious and final judgment of Christ:
"When the Son of man," he says, "shall come in His glory, ...
then shall He say also unto them on His left hand, Depart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span>
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil
and his angels."<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id="FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> Then He in like manner recounts to the
wicked the things they had not done, but which He had said
those on the right hand had done. And when they ask when
they had seen Him in need of these things, He replies that,
inasmuch as they had not done it to the least of His brethren,
they had not done it unto Him, and concludes His address in
the words, "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment,
but the righteous into life eternal." Moreover, the evangelist
John most distinctly states that He had predicted that the
judgment should be at the resurrection of the dead. For after
saying, "The Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all
judgment unto the Son; that all men should honour the Son,
even as they honour the Father: he that honoureth not the
Son, honoureth not the Father which hath sent Him;" He immediately
adds, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth
my word and believeth on Him that sent me, hath everlasting
life, and shall not come into judgment; but is passed from death
to life."<a name="FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Here He said that believers on Him should not
come into judgment. How, then, shall they be separated from
the wicked by judgment, and be set at His right hand, unless
judgment be in this passage used for condemnation? For into
judgment, in this sense, they shall not come who hear His
word, and believe on Him that sent Him.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>What is the first resurrection, and what the second.</i></p>

<p>After that He adds the words, "Verily, verily, I say unto
you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall
hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall
live. For as the Father hath life in Himself; so hath He
given to the Son to have life in Himself."<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id="FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class="fnanchor">[694]</a> As yet He does
not speak of the second resurrection, that is, the resurrection
of the body, which shall be in the end, but of the first, which
now is. It is for the sake of making this distinction that He
says, "The hour is coming, and now is." Now this resurrection
regards not the body, but the soul. For souls, too, have a
death of their own in wickedness and sins, whereby they are
the dead of whom the same lips say, "Suffer the dead to bury<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
their dead,"<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id="FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class="fnanchor">[695]</a>&mdash;that is, let those who are dead in soul bury them
that are dead in body. It is of these dead, then&mdash;the dead
in ungodliness and wickedness&mdash;that He says, "The hour is
coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the
Son of God; and they that hear shall live." "They that hear,"
that is, they who obey, believe, and persevere to the end.
Here no difference is made between the good and the bad.
For it is good for all men to hear His voice and live, by
passing to the life of godliness from the death of ungodliness.
Of this death the Apostle Paul says, "Therefore all are dead,
and He died for all, that they which live should not henceforth
live unto themselves, but unto Him which died for them and
rose again."<a name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> Thus all, without one exception, were dead in
sins, whether original or voluntary sins, sins of ignorance, or
sins committed against knowledge; and for all the dead there
died the one only person who lived, that is, who had no sin
whatever, in order that they who live by the remission of
their sins should live, not to themselves, but to Him who
died for all, for our sins, and rose again for our justification,
that we, believing in Him who justifies the ungodly, and
being justified from ungodliness or quickened from death,
may be able to attain to the first resurrection which now is.
For in this first resurrection none have a part save those who
shall be eternally blessed; but in the second, of which He
goes on to speak, all, as we shall learn, have a part, both the
blessed and the wretched. The one is the resurrection of
mercy, the other of judgment. And therefore it is written in
the psalm, "I will sing of mercy and of judgment: unto Thee,
O Lord, will I sing."<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id="FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class="fnanchor">[697]</a></p>

<p>And of this judgment He went on to say, "And hath given
Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is the
Son of man." Here He shows that He will come to judge in
that flesh in which He had come to be judged. For it is to
show this He says, "because He is the Son of man." And
then follow the words for our purpose: "Marvel not at this:
for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves
shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have
done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment."<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id="FNanchor_698_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_698" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> This judgment
He uses here in the same sense as a little before, when
He says, "He that heareth my word, and believeth on Him
that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come into
<i>judgment</i>, but is passed from death to life;" <i>i.e.</i>, by having a
part in the first resurrection, by which a transition from death
to life is made in this present time, he shall not come into
damnation, which He mentions by the name of judgment, as
also in the place where He says, "but they that have done evil
unto the resurrection of judgment," <i>i.e.</i> of damnation. He,
therefore, who would not be damned in the second resurrection,
let him rise in the first. For "the hour is coming, and now
is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and
they that hear shall live," <i>i.e.</i> shall not come into damnation,
which is called the second death; into which death, after the
second or bodily resurrection, they shall be hurled who do not
rise in the first or spiritual resurrection. For "the hour is
coming" (but here He does not say, "and now is," because it
shall come in the end of the world in the last and greatest
judgment of God) "when all that are in the graves shall hear
His voice and shall come forth." He does not say, as in the
first resurrection, "And they that hear shall live." For all
shall not live, at least with such life as ought alone to be
called life because it alone is blessed. For some kind of life
they must have in order to hear, and come forth from the
graves in their rising bodies. And why all shall not live He
teaches in the words that follow: "They that have done good,
to the resurrection of life,"&mdash;these are they who shall live;
"but they that have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment,"&mdash;these
are they who shall not live, for they shall die
in the second death. They have done evil because their life
has been evil; and their life has been evil because it has not
been renewed in the first or spiritual resurrection which now
is, or because they have not persevered to the end in their
renewed life. As, then, there are two regenerations, of which
I have already made mention,&mdash;the one according to faith, and
which takes place in the present life by means of baptism;
the other according to the flesh, and which shall be accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>
in its incorruption and immortality by means of the
great and final judgment,&mdash;so are there also two resurrections,&mdash;the
one the first and spiritual resurrection, which has place in
this life, and preserves us from coming into the second death;
the other the second, which does not occur now, but in the
end of the world, and which is of the body, not of the soul,
and which by the last judgment shall dismiss some into the
second death, others into that life which has no death.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>7. <i>What is written in the Revelation of John regarding the two resurrections,
and the thousand years, and what may reasonably be held on these points.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The evangelist John has spoken of these two resurrections
in the book which is called the Apocalypse, but in such a
way that some Christians do not understand the first of the
two, and so construe the passage into ridiculous fancies. For
the Apostle John says in the foresaid book, "And I saw an
angel come down from heaven.... Blessed and holy is he
that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second
death hath no power; but they shall be priests of God and of
Christ, and shall reign with Him a thousand years."<a name="FNanchor_699_699" id="FNanchor_699_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_699" class="fnanchor">[699]</a> Those
who, on the strength of this passage, have suspected that the
first resurrection is future and bodily, have been moved, among
other things, specially by the number of a thousand years, as
if it were a fit thing that the saints should thus enjoy a kind
of Sabbath-rest during that period, a holy leisure after the
labours of the six thousand years since man was created, and
was on account of his great sin dismissed from the blessedness
of paradise into the woes of this mortal life, so that thus, as it
is written, "One day is with the Lord as a thousand years,
and a thousand years as one day,"<a name="FNanchor_700_700" id="FNanchor_700_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_700" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> there should follow on
the completion of six thousand years, as of six days, a kind of
seventh-day Sabbath in the succeeding thousand years; and
that it is for this purpose the saints rise, viz. to celebrate
this Sabbath. And this opinion would not be objectionable,
if it were believed that the joys of the saints in that Sabbath
shall be spiritual, and consequent on the presence of God;
for I myself, too, once held this opinion.<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id="FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> But, as they assert
that those who then rise again shall enjoy the leisure of immoderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
carnal banquets, furnished with an amount of meat
and drink such as not only to shock the feeling of the temperate,
but even to surpass the measure of credulity itself,
such assertions can be believed only by the carnal. They who
do believe them are called by the spiritual Chiliasts, which
we may literally reproduce by the name Millenarians.<a name="FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> It
were a tedious process to refute these opinions point by point:
we prefer proceeding to show how that passage of Scripture
should be understood.</p>

<p>The Lord Jesus Christ Himself says, "No man can enter
into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first
bind the strong man,"<a name="FNanchor_703_703" id="FNanchor_703_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_703" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>&mdash;meaning by the strong man the devil,
because he had power to take captive the human race; and
meaning by his goods which he was to take, those who had
been held by the devil in divers sins and iniquities, but were
to become believers in Himself. It was then for the binding
of this strong one that the apostle saw in the Apocalypse "an
angel coming down from heaven, having the key of the abyss,
and a chain in his hand. And he laid hold," he says, "on the
dragon, that old serpent, which is called the devil and Satan,
and bound him a thousand years,"&mdash;that is, bridled and restrained
his power so that he could not seduce and gain possession
of those who were to be freed. Now the thousand
years may be understood in two ways, so far as occurs to me:
either because these things happen in the sixth thousand of
years or sixth millennium (the latter part of which is now passing),
as if during the sixth day, which is to be followed by a
Sabbath which has no evening, the endless rest of the saints,
so that, speaking of a part under the name of the whole, he
calls the last part of the millennium&mdash;the part, that is, which
had yet to expire before the end of the world&mdash;a thousand
years; or he used the thousand years as an equivalent for the
whole duration of this world, employing the number of perfection
to mark the fulness of time. For a thousand is the
cube of ten. For ten times ten makes a hundred, that is, the
square on a plane superficies. But to give this superficies
height, and make it a cube, the hundred is again multiplied
by ten, which gives a thousand. Besides, if a hundred is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
sometimes used for totality, as when the Lord said by way of
promise to him that left all and followed Him, "He shall receive
in this world an hundredfold;"<a name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> of which the apostle gives,
as it were, an explanation when he says, "As having nothing,
yet possessing all things,"<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">[705]</a>&mdash;for even of old it had been said,
The whole world is the wealth of a believer,&mdash;with how much
greater reason is a thousand put for totality since it is the
cube, while the other is only the square? And for the same
reason we cannot better interpret the words of the psalm,
"He hath been mindful of His covenant for ever, the word
which He commanded to a thousand generations,"<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id="FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> than by
understanding it to mean "to all generations."</p>

<p>"And he cast him into the abyss,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> cast the devil
into the abyss. By the <i>abyss</i> is meant the countless multitude
of the wicked whose hearts are unfathomably deep in
malignity against the Church of God; not that the devil was
not there before, but he is said to be cast in thither, because,
when prevented from harming believers, he takes more complete
possession of the ungodly. For that man is more abundantly
possessed by the devil who is not only alienated from
God, but also gratuitously hates those who serve God. "And
shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive
the nations no more till the thousand years should be fulfilled."
"Shut him up,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> prohibited him from going out, from doing
what was forbidden. And the addition of "set a seal upon
him" seems to me to mean that it was designed to keep it a
secret who belonged to the devil's party and who did not.
For in this world this is a secret, for we cannot tell whether
even the man who seems to stand shall fall, or whether he
who seems to lie shall rise again. But by the chain and
prisonhouse of this interdict the devil is prohibited and restrained
from seducing those nations which belong to Christ,
but which he formerly seduced or held in subjection. For
before the foundation of the world God chose to rescue these
from the power of darkness, and to translate them into the
kingdom of the Son of His love, as the apostle says.<a name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> For
what Christian is not aware that he seduces nations even now,
and draws them with himself to eternal punishment, but not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
those predestined to eternal life? And let no one be dismayed
by the circumstance that the devil often seduces even those
who have been regenerated in Christ, and begun to walk in
God's way. For "the Lord knoweth them that are His,"<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id="FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> and
of these the devil seduces none to eternal damnation. For
it is as God, from whom nothing is hid even of things future,
that the Lord knows them; not as a man, who sees a man at
the present time (if he can be said to see one whose heart he
does not see), but does not see even himself so far as to be
able to know what kind of person he is to be. The devil,
then, is bound and shut up in the abyss that he may not
seduce the nations from which the Church is gathered, and
which he formerly seduced before the Church existed. For
it is not said "that he should not seduce any man," but "that
he should not seduce the nations"&mdash;meaning, no doubt, those
among which the Church exists&mdash;"till the thousand years
should be fulfilled,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> either what remains of the sixth day
which consists of a thousand years, or all the years which are
to elapse till the end of the world.</p>

<p>The words, "that he should not seduce the nations till the
thousand years should be fulfilled," are not to be understood
as indicating that afterwards he is to seduce only those nations
from which the predestined Church is composed, and from
seducing whom he is restrained by that chain and imprisonment;
but they are used in conformity with that usage frequently
employed in Scripture and exemplified in the psalm,
"So our eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until He have
mercy upon us,"<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id="FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class="fnanchor">[709]</a>&mdash;not as if the eyes of His servants would no
longer wait upon the Lord their God when He had mercy upon
them. Or the order of the words is unquestionably this, "And
he shut him up and set a seal upon him, till the thousand
years should be fulfilled;" and the interposed clause, "that he
should seduce the nations no more," is not to be understood
in the connection in which it stands, but separately, and as if
added afterwards, so that the whole sentence might be read,
"And He shut him up and set a seal upon him till the
thousand years should be fulfilled, that he should seduce the
nations no more,"&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> he is shut up till the thousand years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
be fulfilled, on this account, that he may no more deceive the
nations.</p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Of the binding and loosing of the devil.</i></p>

<p>"After that," says John, "he must be loosed a little season."
If the binding and shutting up of the devil means his being
made unable to seduce the Church, must his loosing be the
recovery of this ability? By no means. For the Church predestined
and elected before the foundation of the world, the
Church of which it is said, "The Lord knoweth them that are
His," shall never be seduced by him. And yet there shall be
a Church in this world even when the devil shall be loosed,
as there has been since the beginning, and shall be always,
the places of the dying being filled by new believers. For a
little after John says that the devil, being loosed, shall draw
the nations whom he has seduced in the whole world to make
war against the Church, and that the number of these enemies
shall be as the sand of the sea. "And they went up on the
breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints
about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God
out of heaven and devoured them. And the devil who seduced
them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the
beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and
night for ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_710_710" id="FNanchor_710_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_710" class="fnanchor">[710]</a> This relates to the last judgment,
but I have thought fit to mention it now, lest any one might
suppose that in that short time during which the devil shall
be loose there shall be no Church upon earth, whether because
the devil finds no Church, or destroys it by manifold persecutions.
The devil, then, is not bound during the whole time
which this book embraces,&mdash;that is, from the first coming of
Christ to the end of the world, when He shall come the second
time,&mdash;not bound in this sense, that during this interval, which
goes by the name of a thousand years, he shall not seduce the
Church, for not even when loosed shall he seduce it. For certainly
if his being bound means that he is not able or not permitted
to seduce the Church, what can the loosing of him
mean but his being able or permitted to do so? But God
forbid that such should be the case! But the binding of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
devil is his being prevented from the exercise of his whole
power to seduce men, either by violently forcing or fraudulently
deceiving them into taking part with him. If he were
during so long a period permitted to assail the weakness of
men, very many persons, such as God would not wish to expose
to such temptation, would have their faith overthrown, or
would be prevented from believing; and that this might not
happen, he is bound.</p>

<p>But when the short time comes he shall be loosed. For he
shall rage with the whole force of himself and his angels for
three years and six months; and those with whom he makes war
shall have power to withstand all his violence and stratagems.
And if he were never loosed, his malicious power would be less
patent, and less proof would be given of the stedfast fortitude of
the holy city: it would, in short, be less manifest what good
use the Almighty makes of his great evil. For the Almighty
does not absolutely seclude the saints from his temptation, but
shelters only their inner man, where faith resides, that by outward
temptation they may grow in grace. And He binds him
that he may not, in the free and eager exercise of his malice,
hinder or destroy the faith of those countless weak persons,
already believing or yet to believe, from whom the Church
must be increased and completed; and he will in the end
loose him, that the city of God may see how mighty an adversary
it has conquered, to the great glory of its Redeemer,
Helper, Deliverer. And what are we in comparison with those
believers and saints who shall then exist, seeing that they
shall be tested by the loosing of an enemy with whom we
make war at the greatest peril even when he is bound?
Although it is also certain that even in this intervening period
there have been and are some soldiers of Christ so wise and
strong, that if they were to be alive in this mortal condition
at the time of his loosing, they would both most wisely
guard against, and most patiently endure, all his snares and
assaults.</p>

<p>Now the devil was thus bound not only when the Church
began to be more and more widely extended among the nations
beyond Judea, but is now and shall be bound till the end of
the world, when he is to be loosed. Because even now men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span>
are, and doubtless to the end of the world shall be, converted
to the faith from the unbelief in which he held them.
And this strong one is bound in each instance in which he is
spoiled of one of his goods; and the abyss in which he is shut
up is not at an end when those die who were alive when first
he was shut up in it, but these have been succeeded, and shall
to the end of the world be succeeded, by others born after
them with a like hate of the Christians, and in the depth of
whose blind hearts he is continually shut up as in an abyss.
But it is a question whether, during these three years and six
months when he shall be loose, and raging with all his force,
any one who has not previously believed shall attach himself
to the faith. For how in that case would the words hold
good, "Who entereth into the house of a strong one to spoil
his goods, unless first he shall have bound the strong one?"
Consequently this verse seems to compel us to believe that
during that time, short as it is, no one will be added to the
Christian community, but that the devil will make war with
those who have previously become Christians, and that, though
some of these may be conquered and desert to the devil, these
do not belong to the predestinated number of the sons of
God: For it is not without reason that John, the same
apostle as wrote this Apocalypse, says in his epistle regarding
certain persons, "They went out from us, but they were not
of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have
remained with us."<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id="FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class="fnanchor">[711]</a> But what shall become of the little
ones? For it is beyond all belief that in these days there shall
not be found some Christian children born, but not yet baptized,
and that there shall not also be some born during that very
period; and if there be such, we cannot believe that their
parents shall not find some way of bringing them to the laver
of regeneration. But if this shall be the case, how shall these
goods be snatched from the devil when he is loose, since into
his house no man enters to spoil his goods unless he has first
bound him? On the contrary, we are rather to believe that
in these days there shall be no lack either of those who fall
away from, or of those who attach themselves to the Church;
but there shall be such resoluteness, both in parents to seek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
baptism for their little ones, and in those who shall then first
believe, that they shall conquer that strong one, even though
unbound,&mdash;that is, shall both vigilantly comprehend, and
patiently bear up against him, though employing such wiles
and putting forth such force as he never before used; and
thus they shall be snatched from him even though unbound.
And yet the verse of the Gospel will not be untrue, "Who
entereth into the house of the strong one to spoil his goods,
unless he shall first have bound the strong one?" For in
accordance with this true saying that order is observed&mdash;the
strong one first bound, and then his goods spoiled; for the
Church is so increased by the weak and strong from all
nations far and near, that by its most robust faith in things
divinely predicted and accomplished, it shall be able to spoil
the goods of even the unbound devil. For as we must own
that, "when iniquity abounds, the love of many waxes cold,"<a name="FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">[712]</a>
and that those who have not been written in the book of life
shall in large numbers yield to the severe and unprecedented
persecutions and stratagems of the devil now loosed, so we
cannot but think that not only those whom that time shall
find sound in the faith, but also some who till then shall be
without, shall become firm in the faith they have hitherto
rejected, and mighty to conquer the devil even though unbound,
God's grace aiding them to understand the Scriptures,
in which, among other things, there is foretold that very end
which they themselves see to be arriving. And if this shall
be so, his binding is to be spoken of as preceding, that there
might follow a spoiling of him both bound and loosed; for it
is of this it is said, "Who shall enter into the house of the
strong one to spoil his goods, unless he shall first have bound
the strong one?"</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>What the reign of the saints with Christ for a thousand years is, and how it
differs from the eternal kingdom.</i></p>

<p>But while the devil is bound, the saints reign with Christ
during the same thousand years, understood in the same way,
that is, of the time of His first coming.<a name="FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> For, leaving out of
account that kingdom concerning which He shall say in the
end, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, take possession of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>
kingdom prepared for you,"<a name="FNanchor_714_714" id="FNanchor_714_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_714" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> the Church could not now be
called His kingdom or the kingdom of heaven unless His
saints were even now reigning with Him, though in another
and far different way; for to His saints He says, "Lo, I am
with you always, even to the end of the world."<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> Certainly
it is in this present time that the scribe well instructed in the
kingdom of God, and of whom we have already spoken, brings
forth from his treasure things new and old. And from the
Church those reapers shall gather out the tares which He
suffered to grow with the wheat till the harvest, as He explains
in the words, "The harvest is the end of the world; and
the reapers are the angels. As therefore the tares are gathered
together and burned with fire, so shall it be in the end of the
world. The Son of man shall send His angels, and they shall
gather out of His kingdom all offences."<a name="FNanchor_716_716" id="FNanchor_716_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_716" class="fnanchor">[716]</a> Can He mean out
of that kingdom in which are no offences? Then it must be
out of His present kingdom, the Church, that they are gathered.
So He says, "He that breaketh one of the least of these commandments,
and teacheth men so, shall be called least in the
kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth and teacheth thus
shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_717_717" id="FNanchor_717_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_717" class="fnanchor">[717]</a> He speaks
of both as being in the kingdom of heaven, both the man who
does not perform the commandments which He teaches,&mdash;for
"to break" means not to keep, not to perform,&mdash;and the man
who does and teaches as He did; but the one He calls least,
the other great. And He immediately adds, "For I say unto
you, that except your righteousness exceed that of the scribes
and Pharisees,"&mdash;that is, the righteousness of those who break
what they teach; for of the scribes and Pharisees He elsewhere
says, "For they say and do not;"<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id="FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>&mdash;unless, therefore,
your righteousness exceed theirs, that is, so that you do not
break but rather do what you teach, "ye shall not enter the
kingdom of heaven."<a name="FNanchor_719_719" id="FNanchor_719_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_719" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> We must understand in one sense the
kingdom of heaven in which exist together both he who breaks
what he teaches and he who does it, the one being least, the
other great, and in another sense the kingdom of heaven into
which only he who does what he teaches shall enter. Consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span>
where both classes exist, it is the Church as it now
is, but where only the one shall exist, it is the Church as it
is destined to be when no wicked person shall be in her.
Therefore the Church even now is the kingdom of Christ, and
the kingdom of heaven. Accordingly, even now His saints
reign with Him, though otherwise than as they shall reign
hereafter; and yet, though the tares grow in the Church
along with the wheat, they do not reign with Him. For they
reign with Him who do what the apostle says, "If ye be risen
with Christ, mind the things which are above, where Christ
sitteth at the right hand of God. Seek those things which
are above, not the things which are on the earth."<a name="FNanchor_720_720" id="FNanchor_720_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> Of such
persons he also says that their conversation is in heaven.<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id="FNanchor_721_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_721" class="fnanchor">[721]</a>
In fine, they reign with Him who are so in His kingdom that
they themselves are His kingdom. But in what sense are
those the kingdom of Christ who, to say no more, though
they are in it until all offences are gathered out of it at the
end of the world, yet seek their own things in it, and not the
things that are Christ's?<a name="FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">[722]</a></p>

<p>It is then of this kingdom militant, in which conflict with
the enemy is still maintained, and war carried on with warring
lusts, or government laid upon them as they yield, until
we come to that most peaceful kingdom in which we shall
reign without an enemy, and it is of this first resurrection in
the present life, that the Apocalypse speaks in the words just
quoted. For, after saying that the devil is bound a thousand
years and is afterwards loosed for a short season, it goes on
to give a sketch of what the Church does or of what is done
in the Church in those days, in the words, "And I saw seats
and them that sat upon them, and judgment was given." It
is not to be supposed that this refers to the last judgment, but
to the seats of the rulers and to the rulers themselves by whom
the Church is now governed. And no better interpretation of
judgment being given can be produced than that which we
have in the words, "What ye bind on earth shall be bound
in heaven; and what ye loose on earth shall be loosed in
heaven."<a name="FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">[723]</a> Whence the apostle says, "What have I to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
with judging them that are without? do not ye judge them
that are within?"<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id="FNanchor_724_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_724" class="fnanchor">[724]</a> "And the souls," says John, "of those
who were slain for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of
God,"&mdash;understanding what he afterwards says, "reigned with
Christ a thousand years,"<a name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>&mdash;that is, the souls of the martyrs
not yet restored to their bodies. For the souls of the pious
dead are not separated from the Church, which even now is
the kingdom of Christ; otherwise there would be no remembrance
made of them at the altar of God in the partaking
of the body of Christ, nor would it do any good in danger
to run to His baptism, that we might not pass from this life
without it; nor to reconciliation, if by penitence or a bad
conscience any one may be severed from His body. For why
are these things practised, if not because the faithful, even
though dead, are His members? Therefore, while these thousand
years run on, their souls reign with Him, though not as yet in
conjunction with their bodies. And therefore in another part
of this same book we read, "Blessed are the dead who die in
the Lord from henceforth: and now, saith the Spirit, that they
may rest from their labours; for their works do follow them."<a name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">[726]</a>
The Church, then, begins its reign with Christ now in the
living and in the dead. For, as the apostle says, "Christ died
that He might be Lord both of the living and of the dead."<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">[727]</a>
But he mentioned the souls of the martyrs only, because they
who have contended even to death for the truth, themselves
principally reign after death; but, taking the part for the
whole, we understand the words of all others who belong to
the Church, which is the kingdom of Christ.</p>

<p>As to the words following, "And if any have not worshipped
the beast nor his image, nor have received his inscription
on their forehead, or on their hand," we must take
them of both the living and the dead. And what this beast is,
though it requires a more careful investigation, yet it is not
inconsistent with the true faith to understand it of the ungodly
city itself, and the community of unbelievers set in
opposition to the faithful people and the city of God. "His
image" seems to me to mean his simulation, to wit, in those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
men who profess to believe, but live as unbelievers. For they
pretend to be what they are not, and are called Christians,
not from a true likeness, but from a deceitful image. For to
this beast belong not only the avowed enemies of the name
of Christ and His most glorious city, but also the tares which
are to be gathered out of His kingdom, the Church, in the end
of the world. And who are they who do not worship the
beast and his image, if not those who do what the apostle
says, "Be not yoked with unbelievers?"<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id="FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class="fnanchor">[728]</a> For such do not
worship, <i>i.e.</i> do not consent, are not subjected; neither do
they receive the inscription, the brand of crime, on their forehead
by their profession, on their hand by their practice.
They, then, who are free from these pollutions, whether they
still live in this mortal flesh, or are dead, reign with Christ
even now, through this whole interval which is indicated by
the thousand years, in a fashion suited to this time.</p>

<p>"The rest of them," he says, "did not live." For now is
the hour when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of
God, and they that hear shall live; and the rest of them
shall not live. The words added, "until the thousand years
are finished," mean that they did not live in the time in which
they ought to have lived by passing from death to life. And
therefore, when the day of the bodily resurrection arrives, they
shall come out of their graves, not to life, but to judgment,
namely, to damnation, which is called the second death. For
whosoever has not lived until the thousand years be finished,
<i>i.e.</i> during this whole time in which the first resurrection is
going on,&mdash;whosoever has not heard the voice of the Son of
God, and passed from death to life,&mdash;that man shall certainly in
the second resurrection, the resurrection of the flesh, pass with
his flesh into the second death. For he goes on to say, "This
is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he that hath
part in the first resurrection," or who experiences it. Now
he experiences it who not only revives from the death of sin,
but continues in this renewed life. "In these the second
death hath no power." Therefore it has power in the rest, of
whom he said above, "The rest of them did not live until the
thousand years were finished;" for in this whole intervening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
time, called a thousand years, however lustily they lived in
the body, they were not quickened to life out of that death in
which their wickedness held them, so that by this revived
life they should become partakers of the first resurrection, and
so the second death should have no power over them.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>What is to be replied to those who think that resurrection pertains only to
bodies and not to souls.</i></p>

<p>There are some who suppose that resurrection can be predicated
only of the body, and therefore they contend that this
first resurrection (of the Apocalypse) is a bodily resurrection.
For, say they, "to rise again" can only be said of things that
fall. Now, bodies fall in death.<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id="FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> There cannot, therefore, be
a resurrection of souls, but of bodies. But what do they say
to the apostle who speaks of a resurrection of souls? For
certainly it was in the inner and not the outer man that those
had risen again to whom he says, "If ye have risen with
Christ, mind the things that are above."<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id="FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> The same sense he
elsewhere conveyed in other words, saying, "That as Christ
has risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also
may walk in newness of life."<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id="FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> So, too, "Awake thou that
sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee
light."<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id="FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> As to what they say about nothing being able to
rise again but what falls, whence they conclude that resurrection
pertains to bodies only, and not to souls, because
bodies fall, why do they make nothing of the words, "Ye that
fear the Lord, wait for His mercy; and go not aside lest
ye fall;"<a name="FNanchor_733_733" id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> and "To his own Master he stands or falls;"<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id="FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class="fnanchor">[734]</a>
and "He that thinketh he standeth, let him take heed lest
he fall?"<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id="FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> For I fancy this fall that we are to take heed
against is a fall of the soul, not of the body. If, then, rising
again belongs to things that fall, and souls fall, it must be
owned that souls also rise again. To the words, "In them
the second death hath no power," are added the words, "but
they shall be priests of God and Christ, and shall reign with
Him a thousand years;" and this refers not to the bishops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>
alone, and presbyters, who are now specially called priests in
the Church; but as we call all believers Christians on account
of the mystical chrism, so we call all priests because they are
members of the one Priest. Of them the Apostle Peter says,
"A holy people, a royal priesthood."<a name="FNanchor_736_736" id="FNanchor_736_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736_736" class="fnanchor">[736]</a> Certainly he implied,
though in a passing and incidental way, that Christ is God,
saying priests of God and Christ, that is, of the Father and
the Son, though it was in His servant-form and as Son of man
that Christ was made a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.
But this we have already explained more than
once.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Of Gog and Magog, who are to be roused by the devil to persecute the
Church, when he is loosed in the end of the world.</i></p>

<p>"And when the thousand years are finished, Satan shall
be loosed from his prison, and shall go out to seduce the
nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and
Magog, and shall draw them to battle, whose number is as
the sand of the sea." This, then, is his purpose in seducing
them, to draw them to this battle. For even before this he
was wont to use as many and various seductions as he could
continue. And the words "he shall go out" mean, he shall
burst forth from lurking hatred into open persecution. For
this persecution, occurring while the final judgment is imminent,
shall be the last which shall be endured by the holy
Church throughout the world, the whole city of Christ being
assailed by the whole city of the devil, as each exists on
earth. For these nations which he names Gog and Magog
are not to be understood of some barbarous nations in some
part of the world, whether the Get√¶ and Massaget√¶, as some
conclude from the initial letters, or some other foreign nations
not under the Roman government. For John marks that
they are spread over the whole earth, when he says, "The
nations which are in the four corners of the earth," and he
added that these are Gog and Magog. The meaning of these
names we find to be, Gog, "a roof," Magog, "from a roof,"&mdash;a
house, as it were, and he who comes out of the house. They
are therefore the nations in which we found that the devil
was shut up as in an abyss, and the devil himself coming out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>
from them and going forth, so that they are the roof, he from
the roof. Or if we refer both words to the nations, not one
to them and one to the devil, then they are both the roof,
because in them the old enemy is at present shut up, and as
it were roofed in; and they shall be from the roof when they
break forth from concealed to open hatred. The words, "And
they went up on the breadth of the earth, and encompassed
the camp of the saints and the beloved city," do not mean
that they have come, or shall come, to one place, as if the
camp of the saints and the beloved city should be in some
one place; for this camp is nothing else than the Church of
Christ extending over the whole world. And consequently
wherever the Church shall be,&mdash;and it shall be in all nations,
as is signified by "the breadth of the earth,"&mdash;there also shall
be the camp of the saints and the beloved city, and there it
shall be encompassed by the savage persecution of all its
enemies; for they too shall exist along with it in all nations,&mdash;that
is, it shall be straitened, and hard pressed, and shut
up in the straits of tribulation, but shall not desert its military
duty, which is signified by the word "camp."</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Whether the fire that came down out of heaven and devoured them refers to
the last punishment of the wicked.</i></p>

<p>The words, "And fire came down out of heaven and devoured
them," are not to be understood of the final punishment
which shall be inflicted when it is said, "Depart from
me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire;"<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id="FNanchor_737_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737_737" class="fnanchor">[737]</a> for then they shall be
cast into the fire, not fire come down out of heaven upon
them. In this place "fire out of heaven" is well understood
of the firmness of the saints, wherewith they refuse to yield
obedience to those who rage against them. For the firmament
is "heaven," by whose firmness these assailants shall be
pained with blazing zeal, for they shall be impotent to draw
away the saints to the party of Antichrist. This is the fire
which shall devour them, and this is "from God;" for it
is by God's grace the saints become unconquerable, and so
torment their enemies. For as in a good sense it is said,
"The zeal of Thine house hath consumed me,"<a name="FNanchor_738_738" id="FNanchor_738_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">[738]</a> so in a bad
sense it is said, "Zeal hath possessed the uninstructed people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
and now fire shall consume the enemies."<a name="FNanchor_739_739" id="FNanchor_739_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739_739" class="fnanchor">[739]</a> "And now," that
is to say, not the fire of the last judgment. Or if by this fire
coming down out of heaven and consuming them, John meant
that blow wherewith Christ in His coming is to strike those
persecutors of the Church whom He shall then find alive upon
earth, when He shall kill Antichrist with the breath of His
mouth,<a name="FNanchor_740_740" id="FNanchor_740_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740_740" class="fnanchor">[740]</a> then even this is not the last judgment of the wicked;
but the last judgment is that which they shall suffer when
the bodily resurrection has taken place.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Whether the time of the persecution of Antichrist should be reckoned in the
thousand years.</i></p>

<p>This last persecution by Antichrist shall last for three years
and six months, as we have already said, and as is affirmed
both in the book of Revelation and by Daniel the prophet.
Though this time is brief, yet not without reason is it questioned
whether it is comprehended in the thousand years in
which the devil is bound and the saints reign with Christ,
or whether this little season should be added over and above
to these years. For if we say that they are included in the
thousand years, then the saints reign with Christ during a
more protracted period than the devil is bound. For they
shall reign with their King and Conqueror mightily even in
that crowning persecution when the devil shall now be unbound
and shall rage against them with all his might. How
then does Scripture define both the binding of the devil and
the reign of the saints by the same thousand years, if the
binding of the devil ceases three years and six months before
this reign of the saints with Christ? On the other hand, if
we say that the brief space of this persecution is not to be
reckoned as a part of the thousand years, but rather as an
additional period, we shall indeed be able to interpret the
words, "The priests of God and of Christ shall reign with
Him a thousand years; and when the thousand years shall be
finished, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison;" for thus they
signify that the reign of the saints and the bondage of the
devil shall cease simultaneously, so that the time of the persecution
we speak of should be contemporaneous neither with
the reign of the saints nor with the imprisonment of Satan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
but should be reckoned over and above as a superadded portion
of time. But then in this case we are forced to admit that
the saints shall not reign with Christ during that persecution.
But who can dare to say that His members shall not reign
with Him at that very juncture when they shall most of all,
and with the greatest fortitude, cleave to Him, and when the
glory of resistance and the crown of martyrdom shall be more
conspicuous in proportion to the hotness of the battle? Or
if it is suggested that they may be said not to reign, because
of the tribulations which they shall suffer, it will follow that
all the saints who have formerly, during the thousand years,
suffered tribulation, shall not be said to have reigned with
Christ during the period of their tribulation, and consequently
even those whose souls the author of this book says that
he saw, and who were slain for the testimony of Jesus and
the word of God, did not reign with Christ when they were
suffering persecution, and they were not themselves the kingdom
of Christ, though Christ was then pre-eminently possessing
them. This is indeed perfectly absurd, and to be scouted.
But assuredly the victorious souls of the glorious martyrs,
having overcome and finished all griefs and toils, and having
laid down their mortal members, have reigned, and do reign,
with Christ till the thousand years are finished, that they
may afterwards reign with Him when they have received
their immortal bodies. And therefore during these three
years and a half the souls of those who were slain for His
testimony, both those which formerly passed from the body
and those which shall pass in that last persecution, shall
reign with Him till the mortal world come to an end, and
pass into that kingdom in which there shall be no death.
And thus the reign of the saints with Christ shall last longer
than the bonds and imprisonment of the devil, because they
shall reign with their King the Son of God for these three
years and a half during which the devil is no longer bound.
It remains, therefore, that when we read that "the priests of
God and of Christ shall reign with Him a thousand years;
and when the thousand years are finished, the devil shall be
loosed from his imprisonment," that we understand either
that the thousand years of the reign of the saints does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span>
terminate, though the imprisonment of the devil does,&mdash;so that
both parties have their thousand years, that is, their complete
time, yet each with a different actual duration appropriate to
itself, the kingdom of the saints being longer, the imprisonment
of the devil shorter,&mdash;or at least that, as three years and
six months is a very short time, it is not reckoned as either
deducted from the whole time of Satan's imprisonment, or as
added to the whole duration of the reign of the saints, as we
have shown above in the sixteenth book<a name="FNanchor_741_741" id="FNanchor_741_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_741" class="fnanchor">[741]</a> regarding the round
number of four hundred years, which were specified as four
hundred, though actually somewhat more; and similar expressions
are often found in the sacred writings, if one will
mark them.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>14. <i>Of the damnation of the devil and his adherents; and a sketch of the bodily
resurrection of all the dead, and of the final retributive judgment.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>After this mention of the closing persecution, he summarily
indicates all that the devil, and the city of which he is the
prince, shall suffer in the last judgment. For he says, "And
the devil who seduced them is cast into the lake of fire and
brimstone, in which are the beast and the false prophet, and
they shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever."
We have already said that by the beast is well understood
the wicked city. His false prophet is either Antichrist or
that image or figment of which we have spoken in the same
place. After this he gives a brief narrative of the last judgment
itself, which shall take place at the second or bodily
resurrection of the dead, as it had been revealed to him: "I
saw a throne great and white, and One sitting on it from
whose face the heaven and the earth fled away, and their
place was not found." He does not say, "I saw a throne
great and white, and One sitting on it, and from His face the
heaven and the earth fled away," for it had not happened
then, <i>i.e.</i> before the living and the dead were judged; but he
says that he saw Him sitting on the throne from whose face
heaven and earth fled away, but afterwards. For when the
judgment is finished, this heaven and earth shall cease to be,
and there will be a new heaven and a new earth. For this
world shall pass away by transmutation, not by absolute destruction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>
And therefore the apostle says, "For the figure
of this world passeth away. I would have you be without
anxiety."<a name="FNanchor_742_742" id="FNanchor_742_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_742" class="fnanchor">[742]</a> The figure, therefore, passes away, not the nature.
After John had said that he had seen One sitting on the
throne from whose face heaven and earth fled, though not till
afterwards, he said, "And I saw the dead, great and small:
and the books were opened; and another book was opened,
which is the book of the life of each man: and the dead were
judged out of those things which were written in the books,
according to their deeds." He said that the books were
opened, and a book; but he left us at a loss as to the nature
of this book, "which is," he says, "the book of the life of each
man." By those books, then, which he first mentioned, we
are to understand the sacred books old and new, that out of
them it might be shown what commandments God had enjoined;
and that book of the life of each man is to show what
commandments each man has done or omitted to do. If this
book be materially considered, who can reckon its size or
length, or the time it would take to read a book in which
the whole life of every man is recorded? Shall there be present
as many angels as men, and shall each man hear his life
recited by the angel assigned to him? In that case there
will be not one book containing all the lives, but a separate
book for every life. But our passage requires us to think of
one only. "And another book was opened," it says. We must
therefore understand it of a certain divine power, by which it
shall be brought about that every one shall recall to memory
all his own works, whether good or evil, and shall mentally
survey them with a marvellous rapidity, so that this knowledge
will either accuse or excuse conscience, and thus all and
each shall be simultaneously judged. And this divine power
is called a book, because in it we shall as it were read all that
it causes us to remember. That he may show who the dead,
small and great, are who are to be judged, he recurs to this
which he had omitted or rather deferred, and says, "And the
sea presented the dead which were in it; and death and hell
gave up the dead which were in them." This of course took
place before the dead were judged, yet it is mentioned after.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span>
And so, I say, he returns again to what he had omitted. But
now he preserves the order of events, and for the sake of
exhibiting it repeats in its own proper place what he had
already said regarding the dead who were judged. For after
he had said, "And the sea presented the dead which were in
it, and death and hell gave up the dead which were in them,"
he immediately subjoined what he had already said, "and
they were judged every man according to their works." For
this is just what he had said before, "And the dead were
judged according to their works."</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Who the dead are who are given up to judgment by the sea, and by death
and hell.</i></p>

<p>But who are the dead which were in the sea, and which the
sea presented? For we cannot suppose that those who die in
the sea are not in hell, nor that their bodies are preserved in
the sea; nor yet, which is still more absurd, that the sea retained
the good, while hell received the bad. Who could
believe this? But some very sensibly suppose that in this
place the sea is put for this world. When John then wished
to signify that those whom Christ should find still alive in the
body were to be judged along with those who should rise
again, he called them dead, both the good to whom it is said,
"For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God,"<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">[743]</a>
and the wicked of whom it is said, "Let the dead bury their
dead."<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id="FNanchor_744_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_744" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> They may also be called dead, because they wear
mortal bodies, as the apostle says, "The body indeed is dead
because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness;"<a name="FNanchor_745_745" id="FNanchor_745_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745_745" class="fnanchor">[745]</a>
proving that in a living man in the body there is both a body
which is dead, and a spirit which is life. Yet he did not say
that the body was mortal, but dead, although immediately
after he speaks in the more usual way of mortal bodies.
These, then, are the dead which were in the sea, and which
the sea presented, to wit, the men who were in this world,
because they had not yet died, and whom the world presented
for judgment. "And death and hell," he says, "gave up the
dead which were in them." The sea <i>presented</i> them because
they had merely to be found in the place where they were;
but death and hell <i>gave them up</i> or <i>restored</i> them, because they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span>
called them back to life, which they had already quitted.
And perhaps it was not without reason that neither <i>death</i> nor
<i>hell</i> were judged sufficient alone, and both were mentioned,&mdash;death
to indicate the good, who have suffered only death and
not hell; hell to indicate the wicked, who suffer also the
punishment of hell. For if it does not seem absurd to believe
that the ancient saints who believed in Christ and His then
future coming, were kept in places far removed indeed from
the torments of the wicked, but yet in hell,<a name="FNanchor_746_746" id="FNanchor_746_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_746" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> until Christ's
blood and His descent into these places delivered them, certainly
good Christians, redeemed by that precious price already
paid, are quite unacquainted with hell while they wait for
their restoration to the body, and the reception of their reward.
After saying, "They were judged every man according
to their works," he briefly added what the judgment was:
"Death and hell were cast into the lake of fire;" by these
names designating the devil and the whole company of his
angels, for he is the author of death and the pains of hell.
For this is what he had already, by anticipation, said in clearer
language: "The devil who seduced them was cast into a lake
of fire and brimstone." The obscure addition he had made
in the words, "in which were also the beast and the false
prophet," he here explains, "They who were not found written
in the book of life were cast into the lake of fire." This book
is not for reminding God, as if things might escape Him by
forgetfulness, but it symbolizes His predestination of those to
whom eternal life shall be given. For it is not that God is
ignorant, and reads in the book to inform Himself, but rather
His infallible prescience is the book of life in which they are
written, that is to say, known beforehand.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>Of the new heaven and the new earth.</i></p>

<p>Having finished the prophecy of judgment, so far as the
wicked are concerned, it remains that he speak also of the
good. Having briefly explained the Lord's words, "These will
go away into everlasting punishment," it remains that he explain
the connected words, "but the righteous into life eternal."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_747_747" id="FNanchor_747_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747_747" class="fnanchor">[747]</a>
"And I saw," he says, "a new heaven and a new earth: for
the first heaven and the first earth have passed away; and
there is no more sea."<a name="FNanchor_748_748" id="FNanchor_748_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_748" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> This will take place in the order
which he has by anticipation declared in the words, "I saw
One sitting on the throne, from whose face heaven and earth
fled." For as soon as those who are not written in the book
of life have been judged and cast into eternal fire,&mdash;the nature
of which fire, or its position in the world or universe, I suppose
is known to no man, unless perhaps the divine Spirit
reveal it to some one,&mdash;then shall the figure of this world pass
away in a conflagration of universal fire, as once before the
world was flooded with a deluge of universal water. And by
this universal conflagration the qualities of the corruptible
elements which suited our corruptible bodies shall utterly
perish, and our substance shall receive such qualities as shall,
by a wonderful transmutation, harmonize with our immortal
bodies, so that, as the world itself is renewed to some better
thing, it is fitly accommodated to men, themselves renewed in
their flesh to some better thing. As for the statement, "And
there shall be no more sea," I would not lightly say whether
it is dried up with that excessive heat, or is itself also turned
into some better thing. For we read that there shall be a
new heaven and a new earth, but I do not remember to have
anywhere read anything of a new sea, unless what I find in
this same book, "As it were a sea of glass like crystal."<a name="FNanchor_749_749" id="FNanchor_749_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_749" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> But
he was not then speaking of this end of the world, neither
does he seem to speak of a literal sea, but "as it were a sea."
It is possible that, as prophetic diction delights in mingling
figurative and real language, and thus in some sort veiling the
sense, so the words "And there is no more sea" may be taken
in the same sense as the previous phrase, "And the sea presented
the dead which were in it." For then there shall be
no more of this world, no more of the surgings and restlessness
of human life, and it is this which is symbolized by the
<i>sea</i>.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of the endless glory of the Church.</i></p>

<p>"And I saw," he says, "a great city, new Jerusalem, coming
down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span>
for her husband. And I heard a great voice from the throne,
saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He
will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God
Himself shall be with them. And God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow, nor crying, but neither shall there be any
more pain: because the former things have passed away. And
He that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things
new."<a name="FNanchor_750_750" id="FNanchor_750_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">[750]</a> This city is said to come down out of heaven, because
the grace with which God formed it is of heaven.
Wherefore He says to it by Isaiah, "I am the Lord that
formed thee."<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id="FNanchor_751_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_751" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> It is indeed descended from heaven from its
commencement, since its citizens during the course of this
world grow by the grace of God, which cometh down from
above through the laver of regeneration in the Holy Ghost
sent down from heaven. But by God's final judgment, which
shall be administered by His Son Jesus Christ, there shall by
God's grace be manifested a glory so pervading and so new,
that no vestige of what is old shall remain; for even our
bodies shall pass from their old corruption and mortality to
new incorruption and immortality. For to refer this promise
to the present time, in which the saints are reigning with their
King a thousand years, seems to me excessively barefaced,
when it is most distinctly said, "God shall wipe away all
tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death,
neither sorrow, nor crying, but there shall be no more pain."
And who is so absurd, and blinded by contentious opinionativeness,
as to be audacious enough to affirm that in the
midst of the calamities of this mortal state, God's people, or
even one single saint, does live, or has ever lived, or shall ever
live, without tears or pain,&mdash;the fact being that the holier a
man is, and the fuller of holy desire, so much the more abundant
is the tearfulness of his supplication? Are not these
the utterances of a citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem: "My
tears have been my meat day and night;"<a name="FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> and "Every night
shall I make my bed to swim; with my tears shall I water
my couch;"<a name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> and "My groaning is not hid from Thee;"<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id="FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>
"My sorrow was renewed?"<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id="FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> Or are not those God's children
who groan, being burdened, not that they wish to be unclothed,
but clothed upon, that mortality may be swallowed
up of life?<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id="FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class="fnanchor">[756]</a> Do not they even who have the first-fruits of
the Spirit groan within themselves, waiting for the adoption,
the redemption of their body?<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id="FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class="fnanchor">[757]</a> Was not the Apostle Paul
himself a citizen of the heavenly Jerusalem, and was he not
so all the more when he had heaviness and continual sorrow
of heart for his Israelitish brethren?<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> But when shall there be
no more death in that city, except when it shall be said, "O
death, where is thy contention?<a name="FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">[759]</a> O death, where is thy sting?
The sting of death is sin."<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id="FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> Obviously there shall be no sin
when it can be said, "Where is"&mdash;But as for the present
it is not some poor weak citizen of this city, but this same
Apostle John himself who says, "If we say that we have no
sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us."<a name="FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">[761]</a> No
doubt, though this book is called the Apocalypse, there are in
it many obscure passages to exercise the mind of the reader,
and there are few passages so plain as to assist us in the
interpretation of the others, even though we take pains; and
this difficulty is increased by the repetition of the same things,
in forms so different, that the things referred to seem to be
different, although in fact they are only differently stated.
But in the words, "God shall wipe away all tears from their
eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
crying, but there shall be no more pain," there is so manifest
a reference to the future world and the immortality and
eternity of the saints,&mdash;for only then and only there shall
such a condition be realized,&mdash;that if we think this obscure,
we need not expect to find anything plain in any part of
Scripture.</p>


<p class="center">18. <i>What the Apostle Peter predicted regarding the last judgment.</i></p>

<p>Let us now see what the Apostle Peter predicted concerning
this judgment. "There shall come," he says, "in the last
days scoffers.... Nevertheless we, according to His promise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>
look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth
righteousness."<a name="FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">[762]</a> There is nothing said here about the resurrection
of the dead, but enough certainly regarding the destruction
of this world. And by his reference to the deluge
he seems as it were to suggest to us how far we should believe
the ruin of the world will extend in the end of the
world. For he says that the world which then was perished,
and not only the earth itself, but also the heavens, by which
we understand the air, the place and room of which was
occupied by the water. Therefore the whole, or almost the
whole, of the gusty atmosphere (which he calls heaven, or
rather the heavens, meaning the earth's atmosphere, and not
the upper air in which sun, moon, and stars are set) was
turned into moisture, and in this way perished together with
the earth, whose former appearance had been destroyed by the
deluge. "But the heavens and the earth which are now, by
the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the
day of judgment and perdition of ungodly men." Therefore
the heavens and the earth, or the world which was preserved
from the water to stand in place of that world which perished
in the flood, is itself reserved to fire at last in the day of the
judgment and perdition of ungodly men. He does not hesitate
to affirm that in this great change men also shall perish: their
nature, however, shall notwithstanding continue, though in
eternal punishments. Some one will perhaps put the question,
If after judgment is pronounced the world itself is to burn,
where shall the saints be during the conflagration, and before
it is replaced by a new heavens and a new earth, since somewhere
they must be, because they have material bodies? We
may reply that they shall be in the upper regions into which
the flame of that conflagration shall not ascend, as neither did
the water of the flood; for they shall have such bodies that
they shall be wherever they wish. Moreover, when they have
become immortal and incorruptible, they shall not greatly dread
the blaze of that conflagration, as the corruptible and mortal

<p class="center">19. <i>What the Apostle Paul wrote to the Thessalonians about the manifestation
of Antichrist which shall precede the day of the Lord.</i></p>

<p>I see that I must omit many of the statements of the
gospels and epistles about this last judgment, that this volume
may not become unduly long; but I can on no account omit
what the Apostle Paul says, in writing to the Thessalonians,
"We beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus
Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id="FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> etc.</p>

<p>No one can doubt that he wrote this of Antichrist and of
the day of judgment, which he here calls the day of the Lord,
nor that he declared that this day should not come unless he
first came who is called the apostate&mdash;apostate, to wit, from
the Lord God. And if this may justly be said of all the ungodly,
how much more of him? But it is uncertain in what
temple he shall sit, whether in that ruin of the temple which
was built by Solomon, or in the Church; for the apostle
would not call the temple of any idol or demon the temple of
God. And on this account some think that in this passage
Antichrist means not the prince himself alone, but his whole
body, that is, the mass of men who adhere to him, along with
him their prince; and they also think that we should render
the Greek more exactly were we to read, not "in the temple
of God," but "for" or "as the temple of God," as if he himself
were the temple of God, the Church.<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id="FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> Then as for the
words, "And now ye know what withholdeth," <i>i.e.</i> ye know
what hindrance or cause of delay there is, "that he might be
revealed in his own time;" they show that he was unwilling
to make an explicit statement, because he said that they knew.
And thus we who have not their knowledge wish and are
not able even with pains to understand what the apostle referred
to, especially as his meaning is made still more obscure
by what he adds. For what does he mean by "For the
mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now
holdeth, let him hold until he be taken out of the way: and
then shall the wicked be revealed?" I frankly confess I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>
not know what he means. I will nevertheless mention such
conjectures as I have heard or read.</p>

<p>Some think that the Apostle Paul referred to the Roman
empire, and that he was unwilling to use language more explicit,
lest he should incur the calumnious charge of wishing
ill to the empire which it was hoped would be eternal; so
that in saying, "For the mystery of iniquity doth already
work," he alluded to Nero, whose deeds already seemed to be
as the deeds of Antichrist. And hence some suppose that he
shall rise again and be Antichrist. Others, again, suppose that
he is not even dead, but that he was concealed that he might
be supposed to have been killed, and that he now lives in
concealment in the vigour of that same age which he had
reached when he was believed to have perished, and will live
until he is revealed in his own time and restored to his kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">[765]</a>
But I wonder that men can be so audacious in their
conjectures. However, it is not absurd to believe that these
words of the apostle, "Only he who now holdeth, let him hold
until he be taken out of the way," refer to the Roman empire,
as if it were said, "Only he who now reigneth, let him reign
until he be taken out of the way." "And then shall the
wicked be revealed:" no one doubts that this means Antichrist.
But others think that the words, "Ye know what
withholdeth," and "The mystery of iniquity worketh," refer
only to the wicked and the hypocrites who are in the Church,
until they reach a number so great as to furnish Antichrist
with a great people, and that this is the <i>mystery</i> of iniquity,
because it seems hidden; also that the apostle is exhorting
the faithful tenaciously to hold the faith they hold when he
says, "Only he who now holdeth, let him hold until he be
taken out of the way," that is, until the mystery of iniquity
which now is hidden departs from the Church. For they
suppose that it is to this same mystery John alludes when in
his epistle he says, "Little children, it is the last time: and
as ye have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are
there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last
time. They went out from us, but they were not of us; for
if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>
with us."<a name="FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">[766]</a> As therefore there went out from the Church
many heretics, whom John calls "many antichrists," at that
time prior to the end, and which John calls "the last time,"
so in the end they shall go out who do not belong to Christ,
but to that last Antichrist, and then he shall be revealed.</p>

<p>Thus various, then, are the conjectural explanations of the
obscure words of the apostle. That which there is no doubt
he said is this, that Christ will not come to judge quick and
dead unless Antichrist, His adversary, first come to seduce
those who are dead in soul; although their seduction is a result
of God's secret judgment already passed. For, as it is
said, "his presence shall be after the working of Satan, with
all power, and signs, and lying wonders, and with all seduction
of unrighteousness in them that perish." For then shall
Satan be loosed, and by means of that Antichrist shall work
with all power in a lying though a wonderful manner. It is
commonly questioned whether these works are called "signs
and lying wonders" because he is to deceive men's senses by
false appearances, or because the things he does, though they
be true prodigies, shall be a lie to those who shall believe
that such things could be done only by God, being ignorant
of the devil's power, and especially of such unexampled power
as he shall then for the first time put forth. For when he
fell from heaven as fire, and at a stroke swept away from the
holy Job his numerous household and his vast flocks, and
then as a whirlwind rushed upon and smote the house and
killed his children, these were not deceitful appearances, and
yet they were the works of Satan to whom God had given
this power. Why they are called signs and lying wonders
we shall then be more likely to know when the time itself
arrives. But whatever be the reason of the name, they shall
be such signs and wonders as shall seduce those who shall
deserve to be seduced, "because they received not the love of
the truth that they might be saved." Neither did the apostle
scruple to go on to say, "For this cause God shall send upon
them the working of error that they should believe a lie."
For God shall <i>send</i>, because God shall permit the devil to do
these things, the permission being by His own just judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>
though the doing of them is in pursuance of the devil's unrighteous
and malignant purpose, "that they all might be
judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
Therefore, being judged, they shall be seduced,
and, being seduced, they shall be judged. But, being judged,
they shall be seduced by those secretly just and justly secret
judgments of God, with which He has never ceased to judge
since the first sin of the rational creatures; and, being seduced,
they shall be judged in that last and manifest judgment administered
by Jesus Christ, who was Himself most unjustly
judged and shall most justly judge.</p>


<p class="center">20. <i>What the same apostle taught in the first Epistle to the Thessalonians
regarding the resurrection of the dead.</i></p>

<p>But the apostle has said nothing here regarding the resurrection
of the dead; but in his first Epistle to the Thessalonians
he says, "We would not have you to be ignorant,
brethren, concerning them which are asleep,"<a name="FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> etc. These
words of the apostle most distinctly proclaim the future resurrection
of the dead, when the Lord Christ shall come to
judge the quick and the dead.</p>

<p>But it is commonly asked whether those whom our Lord
shall find alive upon earth, personated in this passage by the
apostle and those who were alive with him, shall never die
at all, or shall pass with incomprehensible swiftness through
death to immortality in the very moment during which they
shall be caught up along with those who rise again to meet
the Lord in the air? For we cannot say that it is impossible
that they should both die and revive again while they are
carried aloft through the air. For the words, "And so shall
we ever be with the Lord," are not to be understood as if he
meant that we shall always remain in the air with the Lord;
for He Himself shall not remain there, but shall only pass
through it as He comes. For we shall go to meet Him as
He comes, not where He remains; but "so shall we be with
the Lord," that is, we shall be with Him possessed of immortal
bodies wherever we shall be with Him. We seem
compelled to take the words in this sense, and to suppose that
those whom the Lord shall find alive upon earth shall in that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>
brief space both suffer death and receive immortality; for this
same apostle says, "In Christ shall all be made alive;"<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id="FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> while,
speaking of the same resurrection of the body, he elsewhere
says, "That which thou sowest is not quickened, except it
die."<a name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">[769]</a> How, then, shall those whom Christ shall find alive
upon earth be made alive to immortality in Him if they die
not, since on this very account it is said, "That which thou
sowest is not quickened, except it die?" Or if we cannot
properly speak of human bodies as sown, unless in so far as
by dying they do in some sort return to the earth, as also the
sentence pronounced by God against the sinning father of the
human race runs, "Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou
return,"<a name="FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> we must acknowledge that those whom Christ at
His coming shall find still in the body are not included in
these words of the apostle nor in those of Genesis; for, being
caught up into the clouds, they are certainly not sown, neither
going nor returning to the earth, whether they experience no
death at all or die for a moment in the air.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, there meets us the saying of the
same apostle when he was speaking to the Corinthians about
the resurrection of the body, "We shall all rise," or, as other
<span class="smcap">mss.</span> read, "We shall all sleep."<a name="FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> Since, then, there can be
no resurrection unless death has preceded, and since we can
in this passage understand by sleep nothing else than death,
how shall <i>all</i> either sleep or rise again if so many persons
whom Christ shall find in the body shall neither sleep nor
rise again? If, then, we believe that the saints who shall
be found alive at Christ's coming, and shall be caught up to
meet Him, shall in that same ascent pass from mortal to immortal
bodies, we shall find no difficulty in the words of the
apostle, either when he says, "That which thou sowest is
not quickened, except it die," or when he says, "We shall all
rise," or "all sleep," for not even the saints shall be quickened
to immortality unless they first die, however briefly;
and consequently they shall not be exempt from resurrection
which is preceded by sleep, however brief. And why should
it seem to us incredible that that multitude of bodies should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span>
be, as it were, sown in the air, and should in the air forthwith
revive immortal and incorruptible, when we believe, on the
testimony of the same apostle, that the resurrection shall take
place in the twinkling of an eye, and that the dust of bodies
long dead shall return with incomprehensible facility and
swiftness to those members that are now to live endlessly?
Neither do we suppose that in the case of these saints the
sentence, "Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return,"
is null, though their bodies do not, on dying, fall to earth, but
both die and rise again at once while caught up into the air.
For "Thou shalt return to earth" means, Thou shalt at death
return to that which thou wert before life began. Thou
shalt, when exanimate, be that which thou wert before thou
wast animate. For it was into a face of earth that God
breathed the breath of life when man was made a living
soul; as if it were said, Thou art earth with a soul, which
thou wast not; thou shalt be earth without a soul, as thou
wast. And this is what all bodies of the dead are before
they rot; and what the bodies of those saints shall be if they
die, no matter where they die, as soon as they shall give up
that life which they are immediately to receive back again.
In this way, then, they return or go to earth, inasmuch as
from being living men they shall be earth, as that which becomes
cinder is said to go to cinder; that which decays, to
go to decay; and so of six hundred other things. But the
manner in which this shall take place we can now only feebly
conjecture, and shall understand it only when it comes to
pass. For that there shall be a bodily resurrection of the
dead when Christ comes to judge quick and dead, we must
believe if we would be Christians. But if we are unable
perfectly to comprehend the manner in which it shall take
place, our faith is not on this account vain. Now, however,
we ought, as we formerly promised, to show, as far as seems
necessary, what the ancient prophetic books predicted concerning
this final judgment of God; and I fancy no great
time need be spent in discussing and explaining these predictions,
if the reader has been careful to avail himself of the
help we have already furnished.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><a id="chap21"></a>21. <i>Utterances of the prophet Isaiah regarding the resurrection of the dead and
the retributive judgment.</i></p>

<p>The prophet Isaiah says, "The dead shall rise again, and
all who were in the graves shall rise again; and all who are
in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew which is from Thee is
their health, and the earth of the wicked shall fall."<a name="FNanchor_772_772" id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> All
the former part of this passage relates to the resurrection of
the blessed; but the words, "the earth of the wicked shall
fall," is rightly understood as meaning that the bodies of the
wicked shall fall into the ruin of damnation. And if we
would more exactly and carefully scrutinize the words which
refer to the resurrection of the good, we may refer to the first
resurrection the words, "the dead shall rise again," and to
the second the following words, "and all who were in the
graves shall rise again." And if we ask what relates to those
saints whom the Lord at His coming shall find alive upon
earth, the following clause may suitably be referred to them:
"All who are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew which is
from Thee is their health." By "health" in this place it is
best to understand immortality. For that is the most perfect
health which is not repaired by nourishment as by a daily
remedy. In like manner the same prophet, affording hope to
the good and terrifying the wicked regarding the day of judgment,
says, "Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will flow down
upon them as a river of peace, and upon the glory of the
Gentiles as a rushing torrent: their sons shall be carried on
the shoulders, and shall be comforted on the knees. As one
whom his mother comforteth, so shall I comfort you; and ye
shall be comforted in Jerusalem. And ye shall see, and your
heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall rise up like a herb;
and the hand of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers,
and He shall threaten the contumacious. For, behold, the
Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind His chariots, to
execute vengeance with indignation, and wasting with a flame
of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall all the earth be
judged, and all flesh with His sword: many shall be wounded
by the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id="FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> In His promise to the good he says that He
will flow down as a river of peace, that is to say, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span>
greatest possible abundance of peace. With this peace we
shall in the end be refreshed; but of this we have spoken
abundantly in the preceding book. It is this river in which
he says He shall flow down upon those to whom He promises
so great happiness, that we may understand that in the
region of that felicity, which is in heaven, all things are
satisfied from this river. But because there shall thence flow,
even upon earthly bodies, the peace of incorruption and immortality,
therefore he says that He shall flow down as this
river, that He may as it were pour Himself from things above
to things beneath, and make men the equals of the angels.
By "Jerusalem," too, we should understand not that which
serves with her children, but that which, according to the
apostle, is our free mother, eternal in the heavens.<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id="FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> In her
we shall be comforted as we pass toilworn from earth's cares
and calamities, and be taken up as her children on her knees
and shoulders. Inexperienced and new to such blandishments,
we shall be received into unwonted bliss. There we
shall see, and our heart shall rejoice. He does not say what
we shall see; but what but God, that the promise in the
Gospel may be fulfilled in us, "Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God?"<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id="FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> What shall we see but all those
things which now we see not, but believe in, and of which
the idea we form, according to our feeble capacity, is incomparably
less than the reality? "And ye shall see," he says,
"and your heart shall rejoice." Here ye believe, there ye
shall see.</p>

<p>But because he said, "Your heart shall rejoice," lest we
should suppose that the blessings of that Jerusalem are only
spiritual, he adds, "And your bones shall rise up like a herb,"
alluding to the resurrection of the body, and as it were supplying
an omission he had made. For it will not take place
when we have seen; but we shall see when it has taken
place. For he had already spoken of the new heavens and
the new earth, speaking repeatedly, and under many figures,
of the things promised to the saints, and saying, "There shall
be new heavens, and a new earth: and the former shall not be
remembered nor come into mind; but they shall find in it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[Pg 389]</a></span>
gladness and exultation. Behold, I will make Jerusalem an
exultation, and my people a joy. And I will exult in Jerusalem,
and joy in my people; and the voice of weeping shall
be no more heard in her;"<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id="FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> and other promises, which some
endeavour to refer to carnal enjoyment during the thousand
years. For, in the manner of prophecy, figurative and literal
expressions are mingled, so that a serious mind may, by useful
and salutary effort, reach the spiritual sense; but carnal
sluggishness, or the slowness of an uneducated and undisciplined
mind, rests in the superficial letter, and thinks there is
nothing beneath to be looked for. But let this be enough
regarding the style of those prophetic expressions just quoted.
And now, to return to their interpretation. When he had said,
"And your bones shall rise up like a herb," in order to show
that it was the resurrection of the good, though a bodily
resurrection, to which he alluded, he added, "And the hand
of the Lord shall be known by His worshippers." What is
this but the hand of Him who distinguishes those who worship
from those who despise Him? Regarding these the
context immediately adds, "And He shall threaten the contumacious,"
or, as another translator has it, "the unbelieving."
He shall not actually threaten then, but the threats which
are now uttered shall then be fulfilled in effect. "For behold,"
he says, "the Lord shall come as a fire, and as a whirlwind
His chariots, to execute vengeance with indignation, and
wasting with a flame of fire. For with fire of the Lord shall
all the earth be judged, and all flesh with His sword: many
shall be wounded by the Lord." By <i>fire</i>, <i>whirlwind</i>, <i>sword</i>,
he means the judicial punishment of God. For he says that
the Lord Himself shall come as a fire, to those, that is to say,
to whom His coming shall be penal. By His <i>chariots</i> (for the
word is plural) we suitably understand the ministration of
angels. And when he says that all flesh and all the earth
shall be judged with His fire and sword, we do not understand
the spiritual and holy to be included, but the earthly
and carnal, of whom it is said that they "mind earthly
things,"<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id="FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> and "to be carnally minded is death,"<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id="FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> and whom
the Lord calls simply flesh when He says, "My Spirit shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[Pg 390]</a></span>
not always remain in these men, for they are flesh."<a name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> As
to the words, "Many shall be wounded by the Lord," this
wounding shall produce the second death. It is possible,
indeed, to understand <i>fire</i>, <i>sword</i>, and <i>wound</i> in a good sense.
For the Lord said that He wished to send fire on the earth.<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id="FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class="fnanchor">[780]</a>
And the cloven tongues appeared to them as fire when the
Holy Spirit came.<a name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> And our Lord says, "I am not come to
send peace on earth, but a sword."<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">[782]</a> And Scripture says that
the word of God is a doubly sharp sword,<a name="FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">[783]</a> on account of the
two edges, the two Testaments. And in the Song of Songs
the holy Church says that she is wounded with love,<a name="FNanchor_784_784" id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class="fnanchor">[784]</a>&mdash;pierced,
as it were, with the arrow of love. But here, where we read
or hear that the Lord shall come to execute vengeance, it is
obvious in what sense we are to understand these expressions.</p>

<p>After briefly mentioning those who shall be consumed in
this judgment, speaking of the wicked and sinners under the
figure of the meats forbidden by the old law, from which they
had not abstained, he summarily recounts the grace of the
new testament, from the first coming of the Saviour to the
last judgment, of which we now speak; and herewith he concludes
his prophecy. For he relates that the Lord declares
that He is coming to gather all nations, that they may come
and witness His glory.<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id="FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class="fnanchor">[785]</a> For, as the apostle says, "All have
sinned and are in want of the glory of God."<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id="FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> And he says
that He will do wonders among them, at which they shall
marvel and believe in Him; and that from them He will send
forth those that are saved into various nations, and distant
islands which have not heard His name nor seen His glory,
and that they shall declare His glory among the nations, and
shall <i>bring</i> the brethren of those to whom the prophet was
speaking, <i>i.e.</i> shall bring to the faith under God the Father
the brethren of the elect Israelites; and that they shall bring
from all nations an offering to the Lord on beasts of burden
and waggons (which are understood to mean the aids furnished
by God in the shape of angelic or human ministry), to the
holy city Jerusalem, which at present is scattered over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[Pg 391]</a></span>
earth, in the faithful saints. For where divine aid is given,
men believe, and where they believe, they come. And the
Lord compared them, in a figure, to the children of Israel
offering sacrifice to Him in His house with psalms, which is
already everywhere done by the Church; and He promised
that from among them He would choose for Himself priests
and Levites, which also we see already accomplished. For
we see that priests and Levites are now chosen, not from a
certain family and blood, as was originally the rule in the
priesthood according to the order of Aaron, but as befits the
new testament, under which Christ is the High Priest after
the order of Melchisedec, in consideration of the merit which
is bestowed upon each man by divine grace. And these priests
are not to be judged by their mere title, which is often borne
by unworthy men, but by that holiness which is not common
to good men and bad.</p>

<p>After having thus spoken of this mercy of God which is
now experienced by the Church, and is very evident and
familiar to us, he foretells also the ends to which men shall
come when the last judgment has separated the good and the
bad, saying by the prophet, or the prophet himself speaking
for God, "For as the new heavens and the new earth shall
remain before me, said the Lord, so shall your seed and your
name remain, and there shall be to them month after month,
and Sabbath after Sabbath. All flesh shall come to worship
before me in Jerusalem, said the Lord. And they shall go
out, and shall see the members of the men who have sinned
against me: their worm shall not die, neither shall their
fire be quenched; and they shall be for a spectacle to all
flesh."<a name="FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> At this point the prophet closed his book, as at
this point the world shall come to an end. Some, indeed,
have translated "carcases"<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id="FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class="fnanchor">[788]</a> instead of "members of the men,"
meaning by <i>carcases</i> the manifest punishment of the body,
although <i>carcase</i> is commonly used only of dead flesh, while
the bodies here spoken of shall be animated, else they could
not be sensible of any pain; but perhaps they may, without
absurdity, be called carcases, as being the bodies of those who
are to fall into the second death. And for the same reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[Pg 392]</a></span>
it is said, as I have already quoted, by this same prophet,
"The earth of the wicked shall fall."<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id="FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> It is obvious that
those translators who use a different word for <i>men</i> do not
mean to include only males, for no one will say that the
women who sinned shall not appear in that judgment; but
the male sex, being the more worthy, and that from which
the woman was derived, is intended to include both sexes.
But that which is especially pertinent to our subject is this,
that since the words "All flesh shall come" apply to the good,
for the people of God shall be composed of every race of men,&mdash;for
all men shall not be present, since the greater part
shall be in punishment,&mdash;but, as I was saying, since <i>flesh</i> is
used of the good, and <i>members</i> or <i>carcases</i> of the bad, certainly
it is thus put beyond a doubt that that judgment in which
the good and the bad shall be allotted to their destinies shall
take place after the resurrection of the body, our faith in
which is thoroughly established by the use of these words.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>What is meant by the good going out to see the punishment of the wicked.</i></p>

<p>But in what way shall the good go out to see the punishment
of the wicked? Are they to leave their happy abodes
by a bodily movement, and proceed to the places of punishment,
so as to witness the torments of the wicked in their
bodily presence? Certainly not; but they shall go out by
knowledge. For this expression, <i>go out</i>, signifies that those
who shall be punished shall be without. And thus the Lord
also calls these places "the outer darkness,"<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> to which is
opposed that entrance concerning which it is said to the
good servant, "Enter into the joy of thy Lord," that it may
not be supposed that the wicked can enter thither and be
known, but rather that the good by their knowledge go out
to them, because the good are to know that which is without.
For those who shall be in torment shall not know what is
going on within in the joy of the Lord; but they who shall
enter into that joy shall know what is going on outside in
the outer darkness. Therefore it is said, "They shall go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
out," because they shall know what is done by those who are
without. For if the prophets were able to know things that
had not yet happened, by means of that indwelling of God in
their minds, limited though it was, shall not the immortal
saints know things that have already happened, when God
shall be all in all?<a name="FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> The seed, then, and the name of the
saints shall remain in that blessedness,&mdash;the seed, to wit, of
which John says, "And his seed remaineth in him;"<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> and the
name, of which it was said through Isaiah himself, "I will
give them an everlasting name."<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id="FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> "And there shall be to
them month after month, and Sabbath after Sabbath," as if it
were said, Moon after moon, and rest upon rest, both of which
they shall themselves be when they shall pass from the old
shadows of time into the new lights of eternity. The worm
that dieth not, and the fire that is not quenched, which constitute
the punishment of the wicked, are differently interpreted
by different people. For some refer both to the body,
others refer both to the soul; while others again refer the fire
literally to the body, and the worm figuratively to the soul,
which seems the more credible idea. But the present is not
the time to discuss this difference, for we have undertaken to
occupy this book with the last judgment, in which the good
and the bad are separated: their rewards and punishments we
shall more carefully discuss elsewhere.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>What Daniel predicted regarding the persecution of Antichrist, the
judgment of God, and the kingdom of the saints.</i></p>

<p>Daniel prophesies of the last judgment in such a way as to
indicate that Antichrist shall first come, and to carry on his
description to the eternal reign of the saints. For when in
prophetic vision he had seen four beasts, signifying four kingdoms,
and the fourth conquered by a certain king, who is
recognised as Antichrist, and after this the eternal kingdom
of the Son of man, that is to say, of Christ, he says, "My
spirit was terrified, I Daniel in the midst of my body, and
the visions of my head troubled me,"<a name="FNanchor_794_794" id="FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> etc. Some have interpreted
these four kingdoms as signifying those of the Assyrians,
Persians, Macedonians, and Romans. They who desire to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[Pg 394]</a></span>
understand the fitness of this interpretation may read Jerome's
book on Daniel, which is written with a sufficiency of care
and erudition. But he who reads this passage, even half-asleep,
cannot fail to see that the kingdom of Antichrist shall
fiercely, though for a short time, assail the Church before the
last judgment of God shall introduce the eternal reign of the
saints. For it is patent from the context that the <i>time</i>, <i>times</i>,
<i>and half a time</i>, means a year, and two years, and half a year,
that is to say, three years and a half. Sometimes in Scripture
the same thing is indicated by months. For though the word
<i>times</i> seems to be used here in the Latin indefinitely, that is
only because the Latins have no dual, as the Greeks have,
and as the Hebrews also are said to have. Times, therefore, is
used for two times. As for the ten kings, whom, as it seems,
Antichrist is to find in the person of ten individuals when he
comes, I own I am afraid we may be deceived in this, and
that he may come unexpectedly while there are not ten kings
living in the Roman world. For what if this number ten
signifies the whole number of kings who are to precede his
coming, as totality is frequently symbolized by a thousand,
or a hundred, or seven, or other numbers, which it is not
necessary to recount?</p>

<p>In another place the same Daniel says, "And there shall
be a time of trouble, such as was not since there was born a
nation upon earth until that time: and in that time all Thy
people which shall be found written in the book shall be delivered.
And many of them that sleep in the mound of
earth shall arise, some to everlasting life, and some to shame
and everlasting confusion. And they that be wise shall shine
as the brightness of the firmament; and many of the just as
the stars for ever."<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_795" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> This passage is very similar to the one
we have quoted from the Gospel,<a name="FNanchor_796_796" id="FNanchor_796_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">[796]</a> at least so far as regards the
resurrection of dead bodies. For those who are there said to
be "in the graves" are here spoken of as "sleeping in the
mound of earth," or, as others translate, "in the dust of
earth." There it is said, "They shall come forth;" so here,
"They shall arise." There, "They that have done good, to the
resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[Pg 395]</a></span>
of judgment;" here, "Some to everlasting life, and
some to shame and everlasting confusion." Neither is it to
be supposed a difference, though in place of the expression
in the Gospel, "All who are in their graves," the prophet does
not say "all," but "many of them that sleep in the mound of
earth." For <i>many</i> is sometimes used in Scripture for <i>all</i>.
Thus it was said to Abraham, "I have set thee as the father
of many nations," though in another place it was said to him,
"In thy seed shall all nations be blessed."<a name="FNanchor_797_797" id="FNanchor_797_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_797" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> Of such a resurrection
it is said a little afterwards to the prophet himself,
"And come thou and rest: for there is yet a day till the
completion of the consummation; and thou shalt rest, and
rise in thy lot in the end of the days."<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id="FNanchor_798_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_798" class="fnanchor">[798]</a></p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Passages from the Psalms of David which predict the end of the world and
the last judgment.</i></p>

<p>There are many allusions to the last judgment in the
Psalms, but for the most part only casual and slight. I cannot,
however, omit to mention what is said there in express
terms of the end of this world: "In the beginning hast Thou
laid the foundations of the earth, O Lord; and the heavens
are the work of Thy hands. They shall perish, but Thou
shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment;
and as a vesture Thou shalt change them, and they shall be
changed: but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not
fail."<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id="FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class="fnanchor">[799]</a> Why is it that Porphyry, while he lauds the piety of
the Hebrews in worshipping a God great and true, and terrible
to the gods themselves, follows the oracles of these gods in
accusing the Christians of extreme folly because they say that
this world shall perish? For here we find it said in the
sacred books of the Hebrews, to that God whom this great
philosopher acknowledges to be terrible even to the gods
themselves, "The heavens are the work of Thy hands: they
shall perish." When the heavens, the higher and more secure
part of the world, perish, shall the world itself be preserved?
If this idea is not relished by Jupiter, whose oracle is quoted
by this philosopher as an unquestionable authority in rebuke
of the credulity of the Christians, why does he not similarly
rebuke the wisdom of the Hebrews as folly, seeing that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[Pg 396]</a></span>
prediction is found in their most holy books? But if this
Hebrew wisdom, with which Porphyry is so captivated that
he extols it through the utterances of his own gods, proclaims
that the heavens are to perish, how is he so infatuated as to
detest the faith of the Christians partly, if not chiefly, on this
account, that they believe the world is to perish?&mdash;though how
the heavens are to perish if the world does not is not easy to
see. And, indeed, in the sacred writings which are peculiar
to ourselves, and not common to the Hebrews and us,&mdash;I
mean the evangelic and apostolic books,&mdash;the following expressions
are used: "The figure of this world passeth away;"<a name="FNanchor_800_800" id="FNanchor_800_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_800" class="fnanchor">[800]</a>
"The world passeth away;"<a name="FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> "Heaven and earth shall pass
away,"<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id="FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class="fnanchor">[802]</a>&mdash;expressions which are, I fancy, somewhat milder than
"They shall <i>perish</i>." In the Epistle of the Apostle Peter, too,
where the world which then was is said to have perished,
being overflowed with water, it is sufficiently obvious what
part of the world is signified by the whole, and in what sense
the word <i>perished</i> is to be taken, and what heavens were kept
in store, reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and
perdition of ungodly men.<a name="FNanchor_803_803" id="FNanchor_803_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_803" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> And when he says a little afterwards,
"The day of the Lord will come as a thief; in the
which the heavens shall pass away with a great rush, and the
elements shall melt with burning heat, and the earth and the
works which are in it shall be burned up;" and then adds,
"Seeing, then, that all these things shall be dissolved, what
manner of persons ought ye to be?"<a name="FNanchor_804_804" id="FNanchor_804_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_804" class="fnanchor">[804]</a>&mdash;these heavens which
are to perish may be understood to be the same which he said
were kept in store reserved for fire; and the elements which
are to be burned are those which are full of storm and disturbance
in this lowest part of the world in which he said
that these heavens were kept in store; for the higher heavens
in whose firmament are set the stars are safe, and remain in
their integrity. For even the expression of Scripture, that
"the stars shall fall from heaven,"<a name="FNanchor_805_805" id="FNanchor_805_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805_805" class="fnanchor">[805]</a> not to mention that a
different interpretation is much preferable, rather shows
that the heavens themselves shall remain, if the stars are to
fall from them. This expression, then, is either figurative, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span>
is more credible, or this phenomenon will take place in this
lowest heaven, like that mentioned by Virgil,&mdash;</p>

<p>But the passage I have quoted from the psalm seems to
except none of the heavens from the destiny of destruction;
for he says, "The heavens are the works of Thy hands: they
shall perish;" so that, as none of them are excepted from the
category of God's works, none of them are excepted from
destruction. For our opponents will not condescend to defend
the Hebrew piety, which has won the approbation of their
gods, by the words of the Apostle Peter, whom they vehemently
detest; nor will they argue that, as the apostle in his
epistle understands a part when he speaks of the whole world
perishing in the flood, though only the lowest part of it, and
the corresponding heavens were destroyed, so in the psalm the
whole is used for a part, and it is said "They shall perish,"
though only the lowest heavens are to perish. But since, as
I said, they will not condescend to reason thus, lest they
should seem to approve of Peter's meaning, or ascribe as
much importance to the final conflagration as we ascribe to
the deluge, whereas they contend that no waters or flames
could destroy the whole human race, it only remains to them
to maintain that their gods lauded the wisdom of the Hebrews
because they had not read this psalm.</p>

<p>It is the last judgment of God which is referred to also in
the 50th Psalm in the words, "God shall come manifestly,
our God, and shall not keep silence: fire shall devour before
Him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about Him. He
shall call the heaven above, and the earth, to judge His
people. Gather His saints together to Him; they who make
a covenant with Him over sacrifices."<a name="FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> This we understand
of our Lord Jesus Christ, whom we look for from heaven to
judge the quick and the dead. For He shall come manifestly
to judge justly the just and the unjust, who before came
hiddenly to be unjustly judged by the unjust. He, I say,
shall come manifestly, and shall not keep silence, that is, shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[Pg 398]</a></span>
make Himself known by His voice of judgment, who before,
when He came hiddenly, was silent before His judge when
He was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and, as a lamb before
the shearer, opened not His mouth, as we read that it was
prophesied of Him by Isaiah,<a name="FNanchor_808_808" id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> and as we see it fulfilled in the
Gospel.<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> As for the <i>fire</i> and <i>tempest</i>, we have already said
how these are to be interpreted when we were explaining a
similar passage in Isaiah.<a name="FNanchor_810_810" id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class="fnanchor">[810]</a> As to the expression, "He shall
call the heaven above," as the saints and the righteous are
rightly called <i>heaven</i>, no doubt this means what the apostle
says, "We shall be caught up together with them in the
clouds, to meet the Lord in the air."<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id="FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> For if we take the
bare literal sense, how is it possible to call the heaven above,
as if the heaven could be anywhere else than above? And
the following expression, "And the earth to judge His people,"
if we supply only the words, "He shall call," that is to say,
"He shall call the earth also," and do not supply "above,"
seems to give us a meaning in accordance with sound doctrine,
the heaven symbolizing those who will judge along with
Christ, and the earth those who shall be judged; and thus
the words, "He shall call the heaven above," would not
mean, "He shall catch up into the air," but "He shall lift up
to seats of judgment." Possibly, too, "He shall call the
heaven," may mean, He shall call the angels in the high and
lofty places, that He may descend with them to do judgment;
and "He shall call the earth also" would then mean, He shall
call the men on the earth to judgment. But if with the words
"and the earth" we understand not only "He shall call," but
also "above," so as to make the full sense be, He shall call
the heaven above, and He shall call the earth above, then I
think it is best understood of the men who shall be caught
up to meet Christ in the air, and that they are called <i>the
heaven</i> with reference to their souls, and <i>the earth</i> with reference
to their bodies. Then what is "to judge His people,"
but to separate by judgment the good from the bad, as the
sheep from the goats? Then he turns to address the angels:
"Gather His saints together unto Him." For certainly a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[Pg 399]</a></span>
matter so important must be accomplished by the ministry of
angels. And if we ask who the saints are who are gathered
unto Him by the angels, we are told, "They who make a
covenant with Him over sacrifices." This is the whole life of
the saints, to make a covenant with God over sacrifices. For
"over sacrifices" either refers to works of mercy, which are
preferable to sacrifices in the judgment of God, who says,
"I desire mercy more than sacrifices;"<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id="FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> or if "over sacrifices"
means in sacrifices, then these very works of mercy are
the sacrifices with which God is pleased, as I remember to
have stated in the tenth book of this work;<a name="FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">[813]</a> and in these
works the saints make a covenant with God, because they do
them for the sake of the promises which are contained in His
new testament or covenant. And hence, when His saints
have been gathered to Him and set at His right hand in the
last judgment, Christ shall say, "Come, ye blessed of my
Father, take possession of the kingdom prepared for you from
the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and ye gave
me to eat,"<a name="FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">[814]</a> and so on, mentioning the good works of the
good, and their eternal rewards assigned by the last sentence
of the Judge.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>25. <i>Of Malachi's prophecy, in which he speaks of the last judgment, and of a
cleansing which some are to undergo by purifying punishments.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The prophet Malachi or Malachias, who is also called Angel,
and is by some (for Jerome<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> tells us that this is the opinion
of the Hebrews) identified with Ezra the priest,<a name="FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">[816]</a> others of
whose writings have been received into the canon, predicts
the last judgment, saying, "Behold, He cometh, saith the Lord
Almighty; and who shall abide the day of His entrance? ...
for I am the Lord your God, and I change not."<a name="FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> From
these words it more evidently appears that some shall in the
last judgment suffer some kind of purgatorial punishments;
for what else can be understood by the word, "Who shall
abide the day of His entrance, or who shall be able to look
upon Him? for He enters as a moulder's fire, and as the
herb of fullers: and He shall sit fusing and purifying as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[Pg 400]</a></span>
over gold and silver: and He shall purify the sons of Levi,
and pour them out like gold and silver?" Similarly Isaiah
says, "The Lord shall wash the filthiness of the sons and
daughters of Zion, and shall cleanse away the blood from their
midst, by the spirit of judgment and by the spirit of burning."<a name="FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">[818]</a>
Unless perhaps we should say that they are cleansed from
filthiness and in a manner clarified, when the wicked are
separated from them by penal judgment, so that the elimination
and damnation of the one party is the purgation of the
others, because they shall henceforth live free from the contamination
of such men. But when he says, "And he shall
purify the sons of Levi, and pour them out like gold and silver,
and they shall offer to the Lord sacrifices in righteousness;
and the sacrifices of Judah and Jerusalem shall be pleasing to
the Lord," he declares that those who shall be purified shall
then please the Lord with sacrifices of righteousness, and consequently
they themselves shall be purified from their own
unrighteousness which made them displeasing to God. Now
they themselves, when they have been purified, shall be sacrifices
of complete and perfect righteousness; for what more
acceptable offering can such persons make to God than themselves?
But this question of purgatorial punishments we
must defer to another time, to give it a more adequate treatment.
By the sons of Levi and Judah and Jerusalem we
ought to understand the Church herself, gathered not from
the Hebrews only, but from other nations as well; nor such
a Church as she now is, when "if we say that we have no sin,
we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us,"<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id="FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> but as she
shall then be, purged by the last judgment as a threshing-floor
by a winnowing wind, and those of her members who need it
being cleansed by fire, so that there remains absolutely not
one who offers sacrifice for his sins. For all who make such
offerings are assuredly in their sins, for the remission of which
they make offerings, that having made to God an acceptable
offering, they may then be absolved.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>Of the sacrifices offered to God by the saints, which are to be pleasing to Him,
as in the primitive days and former years.</i></p>

<p>And it was with the design of showing that His city shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>
not then follow this custom, that God said that the sons of
Levi should offer sacrifices in righteousness,&mdash;not therefore in
sin, and consequently not for sin. And hence we see how
vainly the Jews promise themselves a return of the old times of
sacrificing according to the law of the old testament, grounding
on the words which follow, "And the sacrifice of Judah and
Jerusalem shall be pleasing to the Lord, as in the primitive
days, and as in former years." For in the times of the law
they offered sacrifices not in righteousness but in sins, offering
especially and primarily for sins, so much so that even the
priest himself, whom we must suppose to have been their most
righteous man, was accustomed to offer, according to God's
commandments, first for his own sins, and then for the sins
of the people. And therefore we must explain how we are
to understand the words, "as in the primitive days, and as in
former years;" for perhaps he alludes to the time in which
our first parents were in paradise. Then, indeed, intact and
pure from all stain and blemish of sin, they offered themselves
to God as the purest sacrifices. But since they were banished
thence on account of their transgression, and human nature
was condemned in them, with the exception of the one Mediator
and those who have been baptized, and are as yet infants,
"there is none clean from stain, not even the babe whose life
has been but for a day upon the earth."<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">[820]</a> But if it be replied
that those who offer in faith may be said to offer in righteousness,
because the righteous lives by faith,<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id="FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class="fnanchor">[821]</a>&mdash;he deceives himself,
however, if he says that he has no sin, and therefore he
does not say so, because he lives by faith,&mdash;will any man say
this time of faith can be placed on an equal footing with that
consummation when they who offer sacrifices in righteousness
shall be purified by the fire of the last judgment? And consequently,
since it must be believed that after such a cleansing
the righteous shall retain no sin, assuredly that time, so far as
regards its freedom from sin, can be compared to no other
period, unless to that during which our first parents lived in
paradise in the most innocent happiness before their transgression.
It is this period, then, which is properly understood
when it is said, "as in the primitive days, and as in former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[Pg 402]</a></span>
years." For in Isaiah, too, after the new heavens and the new
earth have been promised, among other elements in the blessedness
of the saints which are there depicted by allegories and
figures, from giving an adequate explanation of which I am
prevented by a desire to avoid prolixity, it is said, "According
to the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people."<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id="FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class="fnanchor">[822]</a>
And who that has looked at Scripture does not know where
God planted the tree of life, from whose fruit He excluded
our first parents when their own iniquity ejected them from
paradise, and round which a terrible and fiery fence was set?</p>

<p>But if any one contends that those days of the tree of life
mentioned by the prophet Isaiah are the present times of the
Church of Christ, and that Christ Himself is prophetically
called the Tree of Life, because He is Wisdom, and of wisdom
Solomon says, "It is a tree of life to all who embrace it;"<a name="FNanchor_823_823" id="FNanchor_823_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_823" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
and if they maintain that our first parents did not pass <i>years</i>
in paradise, but were driven from it so soon that none of their
children were begotten there, and that therefore that time
cannot be alluded to in words which run, "as in the primitive
days, and as in former years," I forbear entering on this question,
lest by discussing everything I become prolix, and leave
the whole subject in uncertainty. For I see another meaning,
which should keep us from believing that a restoration of the
primitive days and former years of the legal sacrifices could
have been promised to us by the prophet as a great boon.
For the animals selected as victims under the old law were
required to be immaculate, and free from all blemish whatever,
and symbolized holy men free from all sin, the only instance
of which character was found in Christ. As, therefore,
after the judgment those who are worthy of such purification
shall be purified even by fire, and shall be rendered thoroughly
sinless, and shall offer themselves to God in righteousness, and
be indeed victims immaculate and free from all blemish whatever,
they shall then certainly be "as in the primitive days,
and as in former years," when the purest victims were offered,
the shadow of this future reality. For there shall then be in
the body and soul of the saints the purity which was symbolized
in the bodies of these victims.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[Pg 403]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, with reference to those who are worthy not of cleansing
but of damnation, He says, "And I will draw near to you
to judgment, and I will be a swift witness against evil-doers
and against adulterers;" and after enumerating other damnable
crimes, He adds, "For I am the Lord your God, and I am not
changed." It is as if He said, Though your fault has changed
you for the worse, and my grace has changed you for the
better, I am not changed. And he says that He Himself will
be a witness, because in His judgment He needs no witnesses;
and that He will be "swift," either because He is to come
suddenly, and the judgment which seemed to lag shall be very
swift by His unexpected arrival, or because He will convince
the consciences of men directly and without any prolix
harangue. "For," as it is written, "in the thoughts of the
wicked His examination shall be conducted."<a name="FNanchor_824_824" id="FNanchor_824_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_824" class="fnanchor">[824]</a> And the
apostle says, "The thoughts accusing or else excusing, in the
day in which God shall judge the hidden things of men, according
to my gospel in Jesus Christ."<a name="FNanchor_825_825" id="FNanchor_825_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_825" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> Thus, then, shall the
Lord be a swift witness, when He shall suddenly bring back
into the memory that which shall convince and punish the
conscience.</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Of the separation of the good and the bad, which proclaim the discriminating
influence of the last judgment.</i></p>

<p>The passage also which I formerly quoted for another purpose
from this prophet refers to the last judgment, in which
he says, "They shall be mine, saith the Lord Almighty, in
the day in which I make up my gains,"<a name="FNanchor_826_826" id="FNanchor_826_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_826" class="fnanchor">[826]</a> etc. When this
diversity between the rewards and punishments which distinguish
the righteous from the wicked shall appear under that
Sun of righteousness in the brightness of life eternal,&mdash;a diversity
which is not discerned under this sun which shines on
the vanity of this life,&mdash;there shall then be such a judgment as
has never before been.</p>


<p class="center">28. <i>That the law of Moses must be spiritually understood to preclude the
damnable murmurs of a carnal interpretation.</i></p>

<p>In the succeeding words, "Remember the law of Moses
my servant, which I commanded to him in Horeb for all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[Pg 404]</a></span>
Israel,"<a name="FNanchor_827_827" id="FNanchor_827_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_827" class="fnanchor">[827]</a> the prophet opportunely mentions precepts and statutes,
after declaring the important distinction hereafter to be
made between those who observe and those who despise the
law. He intends also that they learn to interpret the law
spiritually, and find Christ in it, by whose judgment that
separation between the good and the bad is to be made. For
it is not without reason that the Lord Himself says to the
Jews, "Had ye believed Moses, ye would have believed me;
for he wrote of me."<a name="FNanchor_828_828" id="FNanchor_828_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_828" class="fnanchor">[828]</a> For by receiving the law carnally,
without perceiving that its earthly promises were figures of
things spiritual, they fell into such murmurings as audaciously
to say, "It is vain to serve God; and what profit is it that
we have kept His ordinance, and that we have walked suppliantly
before the face of the Lord Almighty? And now
we call aliens happy; yea, they that work wickedness are set
up."<a name="FNanchor_829_829" id="FNanchor_829_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_829" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> It was these words of theirs which in a manner compelled
the prophet to announce the last judgment, in which
the wicked shall not even in appearance be happy, but shall
manifestly be most miserable; and in which the good shall
be oppressed with not even a transitory wretchedness, but
shall enjoy unsullied and eternal felicity. For he had previously
cited some similar expressions of those who said,
"Every one that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord,
and such are pleasing to Him."<a name="FNanchor_830_830" id="FNanchor_830_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_830" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> It was, I say, by understanding
the law of Moses carnally that they had come to
murmur thus against God. And hence, too, the writer of the
73d Psalm says that his feet were almost gone, his steps had
well-nigh slipped, because he was envious of sinners while he
considered their prosperity, so that he said among other things,
How doth God know, and is there knowledge in the Most
High? and again, Have I sanctified my heart in vain, and
washed my hands in innocency?<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id="FNanchor_831_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_831" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> He goes on to say that his
efforts to solve this most difficult problem, which arises when
the good seem to be wretched and the wicked happy, were in
vain until he went into the sanctuary of God, and understood
the last things.<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id="FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class="fnanchor">[832]</a> For in the last judgment things shall not be
so; but in the manifest felicity of the righteous and manifest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
misery of the wicked quite another state of things shall
appear.</p>


<p class="center">29. <i>Of the coming of Elias before the judgment, that the Jews may be converted
to Christ by his preaching and explanation of Scripture.</i></p>

<p>After admonishing them to give heed to the law of Moses,
as he foresaw that for a long time to come they would not
understand it spiritually and rightly, he went on to say, "And,
behold, I will send to you Elias the Tishbite before the great
and signal day of the Lord come: and he shall turn the heart
of the father to the son, and the heart of a man to his next
of kin, lest I come and utterly smite the earth."<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id="FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> It is a
familiar theme in the conversation and heart of the faithful,
that in the last days before the judgment the Jews shall believe
in the true Christ, that is, our Christ, by means of this
great and admirable prophet Elias who shall expound the law
to them. For not without reason do we hope that before the
coming of our Judge and Saviour Elias shall come, because
we have good reason to believe that he is now alive; for, as
Scripture most distinctly informs us,<a name="FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> he was taken up from
this life in a chariot of fire. When, therefore, he is come, he
shall give a spiritual explanation of the law which the Jews
at present understand carnally, and shall thus "turn the heart
of the father to the son," that is, the heart of fathers to their
children; for the Septuagint translators have frequently put
the singular for the plural number. And the meaning is, that
the sons, that is, the Jews, shall understand the law as the
fathers, that is, the prophets, and among them Moses himself,
understood it. For the heart of the fathers shall be turned to
their children when the children understand the law as their
fathers did; and the heart of the children shall be turned to
their fathers when they have the same sentiments as the
fathers. The Septuagint used the expression, "and the heart
of a man to his next of kin," because fathers and children are
eminently neighbours to one another. Another and a preferable
sense can be found in the words of the Septuagint translators,
who have translated Scripture with an eye to prophecy,
the sense, viz., that Elias shall turn the heart of God the Father
to the Son, not certainly as if he should bring about this love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
of the Father for the Son, but meaning that he should make
it known, and that the Jews also, who had previously hated,
should then love the Son who is our Christ. For so far as
regards the Jews, God has His heart turned away from our
Christ, this being their conception about God and Christ.
But in their case the heart of God shall be turned to the
Son when they themselves shall turn in heart, and learn the
love of the Father towards the Son. The words following,
"and the heart of a man to his next of kin,"&mdash;that is, Elias shall
also turn the heart of a man to his next of kin,&mdash;how can we
understand this better than as the heart of a man to the man
Christ? For though in the form of God He is our God,
yet, taking the form of a servant, He condescended to become
also our next of kin. It is this, then, which Elias will do,
"lest," he says, "I come and smite the earth utterly." For
they who mind earthly things are the earth. Such are the
carnal Jews until this day; and hence these murmurs of theirs
against God, "The wicked are pleasing to Him," and "It is a
vain thing to serve God."<a name="FNanchor_835_835" id="FNanchor_835_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_835" class="fnanchor">[835]</a></p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>30. <i>That in the books of the Old Testament, where it is said that God shall judge
the world, the person of Christ is not explicitly indicated, but it plainly
appears from some passages in which the Lord God speaks that Christ is
meant.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There are many other passages of Scripture bearing on the
last judgment of God,&mdash;so many, indeed, that to cite them all
would swell this book to an unpardonable size. Suffice it to
have proved that both Old and New Testament enounce the
judgment. But in the Old it is not so definitely declared as
in the New that the judgment shall be administered by Christ,
that is, that Christ shall descend from heaven as the Judge;
for when it is therein stated by the Lord God or His prophet
that the Lord God shall come, we do not necessarily understand
this of Christ. For both the Father, and the Son, and
the Holy Ghost are the Lord God. We must not, however,
leave this without proof. And therefore we must first show
how Jesus Christ speaks in the prophetical books under the title
of the Lord God, while yet there can be no doubt that it is
Jesus Christ who speaks; so that in other passages where this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
is not at once apparent, and where nevertheless it is said that
the Lord God will come to that last judgment, we may understand
that Jesus Christ is meant. There is a passage in the
prophet Isaiah which illustrates what I mean. For God says
by the prophet, "Hear me, Jacob and Israel, whom I call. I
am the first, and I am for ever: and my hand has founded
the earth, and my right hand has established the heaven. I
will call them, and they shall stand together, and be gathered,
and hear. Who has declared to them these things? In love
of thee I have done thy pleasure upon Babylon, that I might
take away the seed of the Chaldeans. I have spoken, and I
have called: I have brought him, and have made his way
prosperous. Come ye near unto me, and hear this. I have
not spoken in secret from the beginning; when they were
made, there was I. And now the Lord God and His Spirit
hath sent me."<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id="FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> It was Himself who was speaking as the
Lord God; and yet we should not have understood that it
was Jesus Christ had He not added, "And now the Lord
God and His Spirit hath sent me." For He said this with
reference to the form of a servant, speaking of a future event
as if it were past, as in the same prophet we read, "He was
led as a sheep to the slaughter,"<a name="FNanchor_837_837" id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class="fnanchor">[837]</a> not "He shall be led;" but
the past tense is used to express the future. And prophecy
constantly speaks in this way.</p>

<p>There is also another passage in Zechariah which plainly
declares that the Almighty sent the Almighty; and of what
persons can this be understood but of God the Father and
God the Son? For it is written, "Thus saith the Lord
Almighty, After the glory hath He sent me unto the nations
which spoiled you; for he that toucheth you toucheth the
apple of His eye. Behold, I will bring mine hand upon them,
and they shall be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know
that the Lord Almighty hath sent me."<a name="FNanchor_838_838" id="FNanchor_838_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_838" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Observe, the Lord
Almighty saith that the Lord Almighty sent Him. Who can
presume to understand these words of any other than Christ,
who is speaking to the lost sheep of the house of Israel? For
He says in the Gospel, "I am not sent save to the lost sheep
of the house of Israel,"<a name="FNanchor_839_839" id="FNanchor_839_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_839" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> which He here compared to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span>
pupil of God's eye, to signify the profoundest love. And to
this class of sheep the apostles themselves belonged. But
after the glory, to wit, of His resurrection,&mdash;for before it
happened the evangelist said that "Jesus was not yet glorified,"<a name="FNanchor_840_840" id="FNanchor_840_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_840" class="fnanchor">[840]</a>&mdash;He
was sent unto the nations in the persons of His
apostles; and thus the saying of the psalm was fulfilled,
"Thou wilt deliver me from the contradictions of the people;
Thou wilt set me as the head of the nations."<a name="FNanchor_841_841" id="FNanchor_841_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_841" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> So that those
who had spoiled the Israelites, and whom the Israelites had
served when they were subdued by them, were not themselves
to be spoiled in the same fashion, but were in their own persons
to become the spoil of the Israelites. For this had been
promised to the apostles when the Lord said, "I will make
you fishers of men."<a name="FNanchor_842_842" id="FNanchor_842_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_842" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> And to one of them He says, "From
henceforth thou shalt catch men."<a name="FNanchor_843_843" id="FNanchor_843_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_843" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> They were then to become
a spoil, but in a good sense, as those who are snatched
from that strong one when he is bound by a stronger.<a name="FNanchor_844_844" id="FNanchor_844_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_844" class="fnanchor">[844]</a></p>

<p>In like manner the Lord, speaking by the same prophet,
says, "And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek
to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. And I
will pour upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants
of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and mercy; and they shall
look upon me because they have insulted me, and they shall
mourn for Him as for one very dear, and shall be in bitterness
as for an only-begotten."<a name="FNanchor_845_845" id="FNanchor_845_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_845" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> To whom but to God does
it belong to destroy all the nations that are hostile to the
holy city Jerusalem, which "come against it," that is, are
opposed to it, or, as some translate, "come upon it," as if
putting it down under them; or to pour out upon the house
of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace
and mercy? This belongs doubtless to God, and it is to God
the prophet ascribes the words; and yet Christ shows that
He is the God who does these so great and divine things,
when He goes on to say, "And they shall look upon me because
they have insulted me, and they shall mourn for Him
as if for one very dear (or beloved), and shall be in bitterness
for Him as for an only-begotten." For in that day the Jews&mdash;those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span>
of them, at least, who shall receive the spirit of grace and
mercy&mdash;when they see Him coming in His majesty, and recognise
that it is He whom they, in the person of their parents,
insulted when He came before in His humiliation, shall repent
of insulting Him in His passion: and their parents themselves,
who were the perpetrators of this huge impiety, shall
see Him when they rise; but this will be only for their
punishment, and not for their correction. It is not of them
we are to understand the words, "And I will pour upon the
house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
spirit of grace and mercy, and they shall look upon me because
they have insulted me;" but we are to understand the
words of their descendants, who shall at that time believe
through Elias. But as we say to the Jews, You killed Christ,
although it was their parents who did so, so these persons
shall grieve that they in some sort did what their progenitors
did. Although, therefore, those that receive the spirit of
mercy and grace, and believe, shall not be condemned with
their impious parents, yet they shall mourn as if they themselves
had done what their parents did. Their grief shall
arise not so much from guilt as from pious affection. Certainly
the words which the Septuagint have translated, "They
shall look upon me because they insulted me," stand in the
Hebrew, "They shall look upon me whom they pierced."<a name="FNanchor_846_846" id="FNanchor_846_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_846" class="fnanchor">[846]</a>
And by this word the crucifixion of Christ is certainly more
plainly indicated. But the Septuagint translators preferred
to allude to the insult which was involved in His whole
passion. For in point of fact they insulted Him both when
He was arrested and when He was bound, when He was
judged, when He was mocked by the robe they put on Him
and the homage they did on bended knee, when He was
crowned with thorns and struck with a rod on the head, when
He bore His cross, and when at last He hung upon the tree.
And therefore we recognise more fully the Lord's passion
when we do not confine ourselves to one interpretation, but
combine both, and read both "insulted" and "pierced."</p>

<p>When, therefore, we read in the prophetical books that God
is to come to do judgment at the last, from the mere mention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[Pg 410]</a></span>
of the judgment, and although there is nothing else to determine
the meaning, we must gather that Christ is meant; for
though the Father will judge, He will judge by the coming
of the Son. For He Himself, by His own manifested presence,
"judges no man, but has committed all judgment to
the Son;"<a name="FNanchor_847_847" id="FNanchor_847_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_847" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> for as the Son was judged as a man, He shall
also judge in human form. For it is none but He of whom
God speaks by Isaiah under the name of Jacob and Israel, of
whose seed Christ took a body, as it is written, "Jacob is my
servant, I will uphold Him; Israel is mine elect, my Spirit
has assumed Him: I have put my Spirit upon Him; He
shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry,
nor cease, neither shall His voice be heard without. A
bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall
He not quench: but in truth shall He bring forth judgment.
He shall shine and shall not be broken, until He sets judgment
in the earth: and the nations shall hope in His name."<a name="FNanchor_848_848" id="FNanchor_848_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_848" class="fnanchor">[848]</a>
The Hebrew has not "Jacob" and "Israel;" but the Septuagint
translators, wishing to show the significance of the
expression "my servant," and that it refers to the form of a
servant in which the Most High humbled Himself, inserted
the name of that man from whose stock He took the form
of a servant. The Holy Spirit was given to Him, and was
manifested, as the evangelist testifies, in the form of a dove.<a name="FNanchor_849_849" id="FNanchor_849_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_849" class="fnanchor">[849]</a>
He brought forth judgment to the Gentiles, because He predicted
what was hidden from them. In His meekness He
did not cry, nor did He cease to proclaim the truth. But
His voice was not heard, nor is it heard, without, because He
is not obeyed by those who are outside of His body. And the
Jews themselves, who persecuted Him, He did not break,
though as a bruised reed they had lost their integrity, and as
smoking flax their light was quenched; for He spared them,
having come to be judged and not yet to judge. He brought
forth judgment in truth, declaring that they should be
punished did they persist in their wickedness. His face
shone on the Mount,<a name="FNanchor_850_850" id="FNanchor_850_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_850" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> His fame in the world. He is not
broken nor overcome, because neither in Himself nor in His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[Pg 411]</a></span>
Church has persecution prevailed to annihilate Him. And
therefore that has not, and shall not, be brought about which
His enemies said or say, "When shall He die, and His name
perish?"<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id="FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> "until He set judgment in the earth." Behold,
the hidden thing which we were seeking is discovered. For
this is the last judgment, which He will set in the earth
when He comes from heaven. And it is in Him, too, we
already see the concluding expression of the prophecy fulfilled:
"In His name shall the nations hope." And by this fulfilment,
which no one can deny, men are encouraged to believe
in that which is most impudently denied. For who could
have hoped for that which even those who do not yet believe
in Christ now see fulfilled among us, and which is so undeniable
that they can but gnash their teeth and pine away?
Who, I say, could have hoped that the nations would hope in
the name of Christ, when He was arrested, bound, scourged,
mocked, crucified, when even the disciples themselves had
lost the hope which they had begun to have in Him? The
hope which was then entertained scarcely by the one thief on
the cross, is now cherished by nations everywhere on the
earth, who are marked with the sign of the cross on which
He died that they may not die eternally.</p>

<p>That the last judgment, then, shall be administered by
Jesus Christ in the manner predicted in the sacred writings
is denied or doubted by no one, unless by those who, through
some incredible animosity or blindness, decline to believe these
writings, though already their truth is demonstrated to all the
world. And at or in connection with that judgment the following
events shall come to pass, as we have learned: Elias
the Tishbite shall come; the Jews shall believe; Antichrist
shall persecute; Christ shall judge; the dead shall rise; the good
and the wicked shall be separated; the world shall be burned
and renewed. All these things, we believe, shall come to
pass; but how, or in what order, human understanding cannot
perfectly teach us, but only the experience of the events themselves.
My opinion, however, is, that they will happen in the
order in which I have related them.</p>

<p>Two books yet remain to be written by me, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[Pg 412]</a></span>
complete, by God's help, what I promised. One of these will
explain the punishment of the wicked, the other the happiness
of the righteous; and in them I shall be at special pains to
refute, by God's grace, the arguments by which some unhappy
creatures seem to themselves to undermine the divine promises
and threatenings, and to ridicule as empty words statements
which are the most salutary nutriment of faith. But they
who are instructed in divine things hold the truth and omnipotence
of God to be the strongest arguments in favour of
those things which, however incredible they seem to men, are
yet contained in the Scriptures, whose truth has already in
many ways been proved; for they are sure that God can in
no wise lie, and that He can do what is impossible to the
unbelieving.</p>

<h4>ARGUMENT.</h4>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>OF THE END RESERVED FOR THE CITY OF THE DEVIL, NAMELY, THE ETERNAL
PUNISHMENT OF THE DAMNED; AND OF THE ARGUMENTS WHICH UNBELIEF
BRINGS AGAINST IT.</p>


<p>1. <i>Of the order of the discussion, which requires that we first speak of the eternal
punishment of the lost in company with the devil, and then of the eternal
happiness of the saints.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>I propose, with such ability as God may grant me, to
discuss in this book more thoroughly the nature of the
punishment which shall be assigned to the devil and all his
retainers, when the two cities, the one of God, the other of
the devil, shall have reached their proper ends through Jesus
Christ our Lord, the Judge of quick and dead. And I have
adopted this order, and preferred to speak, first of the punishment
of the devils, and afterwards of the blessedness of the
saints, because the <i>body</i> partakes of either destiny; and it
seems to be more incredible that bodies endure in everlasting
torments than that they continue to exist without any pain
in everlasting felicity. Consequently, when I shall have
demonstrated that that punishment ought not to be incredible,
this will materially aid me in proving that which is much
more credible, viz. the immortality of the bodies of the saints
which are delivered from all pain. Neither is this order out
of harmony with the divine writings, in which sometimes,
indeed, the blessedness of the good is placed first, as in the
words, "They that have done good, unto the resurrection of
life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of
damnation;"<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id="FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class="fnanchor">[852]</a> but sometimes also last, as, "The Son of man
shall send forth His angels, and they shall gather out of His
kingdom all things which offend, and shall cast them into a
furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[Pg 414]</a></span>
Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
of His Father;"<a name="FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_853" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> and that, "These shall go away into
everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal."<a name="FNanchor_854_854" id="FNanchor_854_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_854" class="fnanchor">[854]</a>
And though we have not room to cite instances, any one who
examines the prophets will find that they adopt now the one
arrangement and now the other. My own reason for following
the latter order I have given.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Whether it is possible for bodies to last for ever in burning fire.</i></p>

<p>What, then, can I adduce to convince those who refuse to
believe that human bodies, animated and living, can not only
survive death, but also last in the torments of everlasting
fires? They will not allow us to refer this simply to the
power of the Almighty, but demand that we persuade them
by some example. If, then, we reply to them, that there
are animals which certainly are corruptible, because they are
mortal, and which yet live in the midst of flames; and likewise,
that in springs of water so hot that no one can put his
hand in it with impunity a species of worm is found, which
not only lives there, but cannot live elsewhere; they either
refuse to believe these facts unless we can show them, or, if
we are in circumstances to prove them by ocular demonstration
or by adequate testimony, they contend, with the same
scepticism, that these facts are not examples of what we seek
to prove, inasmuch as these animals do not live for ever, and
besides, they live in that blaze of heat without pain, the element
of fire being congenial to their nature, and causing it
to thrive and not to suffer,&mdash;just as if it were not more
incredible that it should thrive than that it should suffer in
such circumstances. It is strange that anything should suffer
in fire and yet live, but stranger that it should live in fire
and not suffer. If, then, the latter be believed, why not also
the former?</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Whether bodily suffering necessarily terminates in the destruction of the flesh.</i></p>

<p>But, say they, there is no body which can suffer and cannot
also die. How do we know this? For who can say with
certainty that the devils do not suffer in their bodies, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
they own that they are grievously tormented? And if it is
replied that there is no earthly body&mdash;that is to say, no solid
and perceptible body, or, in one word, no flesh&mdash;which can
suffer and cannot die, is not this to tell us only what men
have gathered from experience and their bodily senses? For
they indeed have no acquaintance with any flesh but that
which is mortal; and this is their whole argument, that what
they have had no experience of they judge quite impossible.
For we cannot call it reasoning to make pain a presumption
of death, while, in fact, it is rather a sign of life. For though
it be a question whether that which suffers can continue to
live for ever, yet it is certain that everything which suffers
pain does live, and that pain can exist only in a living subject.
It is necessary, therefore, that he who is pained be living, not
necessary that pain kill him; for every pain does not kill even
those mortal bodies of ours which are destined to die. And
that any pain kills them is caused by the circumstance that the
soul is so connected with the body that it succumbs to great
pain and withdraws; for the structure of our members and
vital parts is so infirm that it cannot bear up against that violence
which causes great or extreme agony. But in the life to
come this connection of soul and body is of such a kind, that
as it is dissolved by no lapse of time, so neither is it burst
asunder by any pain. And so, although it be true that in
this world there is no flesh which can suffer pain and yet
cannot die, yet in the world to come there shall be flesh such
as now there is not, as there will also be death such as
now there is not. For death will not be abolished, but
will be eternal, since the soul will neither be able to enjoy
God and live, nor to die and escape the pains of the body.
The first death drives the soul from the body against her will:
the second death holds the soul in the body against her will.
The two have this in common, that the soul suffers against
her will what her own body inflicts.</p>

<p>Our opponents, too, make much of this, that in this world
there is no flesh which can suffer pain and cannot die;
while they make nothing of the fact that there is something
which is greater than the body. For the spirit, whose presence
animates and rules the body, can both suffer pain and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span>
cannot die. Here then is something which, though it can
feel pain, is immortal. And this capacity, which we now see
in the spirit of all, shall be hereafter in the bodies of the
damned. Moreover, if we attend to the matter a little more
closely, we see that what is called bodily pain is rather to be
referred to the soul. For it is the soul, not the body, which
is pained, even when the pain originates with the body,&mdash;the
soul feeling pain at the point where the body is hurt. As then
we speak of bodies feeling and living, though the feeling and
life of the body are from the soul, so also we speak of bodies
being pained, though no pain can be suffered by the body
apart from the soul. The soul, then, is pained with the body
in that part where something occurs to hurt it; and it is
pained alone, though it be in the body, when some invisible
cause distresses it, while the body is safe and sound. Even
when not associated with the body it is pained; for certainly
that rich man was suffering in hell when he cried, "I am
tormented in this flame."<a name="FNanchor_855_855" id="FNanchor_855_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_855" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> But as for the body, it suffers no
pain when it is soulless; and even when animate it can
suffer only by the soul's suffering. If, therefore, we might
draw a just presumption from the existence of pain to that of
death, and conclude that where pain can be felt death can
occur, death would rather be the property of the soul, for to
it pain more peculiarly belongs. But, seeing that that which
suffers most cannot die, what ground is there for supposing
that those bodies, because destined to suffer, are therefore
destined to die? The Platonists indeed maintained that these
earthly bodies and dying members gave rise to the fears, desires,
griefs, and joys of the soul. "Hence," says Virgil (<i>i.e.</i> from
these earthly bodies and dying members),</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hence wild desires and grovelling fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And human laughter, human tears."<a name="FNanchor_856_856" id="FNanchor_856_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_856" class="fnanchor">[856]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>But in the fourteenth book of this work<a name="FNanchor_857_857" id="FNanchor_857_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_857" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> we have proved
that, according to the Platonists' own theory, souls, even when
purged from all pollution of the body, are yet possessed by a
monstrous desire to return again into their bodies. But where
desire can exist, certainly pain also can exist; for desire
frustrated, either by missing what it aims at or losing what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span>
it had attained, is turned into pain. And therefore, if the
soul, which is either the only or the chief sufferer, has yet a
kind of immortality of its own, it is inconsequent to say that
because the bodies of the damned shall suffer pain, therefore
they shall die. In fine, if the body causes the soul to suffer,
why can the body not cause death as well as suffering, unless
because it does not follow that what causes pain causes death
as well? And why then is it incredible that these fires can
cause pain but not death to those bodies we speak of, just as
the bodies themselves cause pain, but not therefore death, to
the souls? Pain is therefore no necessary presumption of
death.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Examples from nature proving that bodies may remain unconsumed
and alive in fire.</i></p>

<p>If, therefore, the salamander lives in fire, as naturalists<a name="FNanchor_858_858" id="FNanchor_858_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_858" class="fnanchor">[858]</a>
have recorded, and if certain famous mountains of Sicily have
been continually on fire from the remotest antiquity until
now, and yet remain entire, these are sufficiently convincing
examples that everything which burns is not consumed. As
the soul, too, is a proof that not everything which can suffer
pain can also die, why then do they yet demand that we
produce real examples to prove that it is not incredible that
the bodies of men condemned to everlasting punishment may
retain their soul in the fire, may burn without being consumed,
and may suffer without perishing? For suitable properties
will be communicated to the substance of the flesh by
Him who has endowed the things we see with so marvellous
and diverse properties, that their very multitude prevents our
wonder. For who but God the Creator of all things has given
to the flesh of the peacock its antiseptic property? This
property, when I first heard of it, seemed to me incredible;
but it happened at Carthage that a bird of this kind was
cooked and served up to me, and, taking a suitable slice of
flesh from its breast, I ordered it to be kept, and when it had
been kept as many days as make any other flesh stinking, it
was produced and set before me, and emitted no offensive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span>
smell. And after it had been laid by for thirty days and
more, it was still in the same state; and a year after, the
same still, except that it was a little more shrivelled, and
drier. Who gave to chaff such power to freeze that it preserves
snow buried under it, and such power to warm that it
ripens green fruit?</p>

<p>But who can explain the strange properties of fire itself,
which blackens everything it burns, though itself bright; and
which, though of the most beautiful colours, discolours almost
all it touches and feeds upon, and turns blazing fuel into
grimy cinders? Still this is not laid down as an absolutely
uniform law; for, on the contrary, stones baked in glowing
fire themselves also glow, and though the fire be rather of a
red hue, and they white, yet white is congruous with light,
and black with darkness. Thus, though the fire burns the
wood in calcining the stones, these contrary effects do not
result from the contrariety of the materials. For though
wood and stone differ, they are not contraries, like black and
white, the one of which colours is produced in the stones,
while the other is produced in the wood by the same action
of fire, which imparts its own brightness to the former, while
it begrimes the latter, and which could have no effect on the
one were it not fed by the other. Then what wonderful properties
do we find in charcoal, which is so brittle that a light
tap breaks it and a slight pressure pulverizes it, and yet is
so strong that no moisture rots it, nor any time causes it to
decay. So enduring is it, that it is customary in laying down
landmarks to put charcoal underneath them, so that if, after
the longest interval, any one raises an action, and pleads that
there is no boundary stone, he may be convicted by the charcoal
below. What then has enabled it to last so long without
rotting, though buried in the damp earth in which [its original]
wood rots, except this same fire which consumes all things?</p>

<p>Again, let us consider the wonders of lime; for besides
growing white in fire, which makes other things black, and
of which I have already said enough, it has also a mysterious
property of conceiving fire within it. Itself cold to the touch,
it yet has a hidden store of fire, which is not at once apparent
to our senses, but which experience teaches us, lies as it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[Pg 419]</a></span>
slumbering within it even while unseen. And it is for this
reason called "quick lime," as if the fire were the invisible
soul quickening the visible substance or body. But the marvellous
thing is, that this fire is kindled when it is extinguished.
For to disengage the hidden fire the lime is moistened or
drenched with water, and then, though it be cold before, it
becomes hot by that very application which cools what is hot.
As if the fire were departing from the lime and breathing its
last, it no longer lies hid, but appears; and then the lime
lying in the coldness of death cannot be requickened, and
what we before called "quick," we now call "slaked." What
can be stranger than this? Yet there is a greater marvel
still. For if you treat the lime, not with water, but with oil,
which is as fuel to fire, no amount of oil will heat it. Now
if this marvel had been told us of some Indian mineral which
we had no opportunity of experimenting upon, we should
either have forthwith pronounced it a falsehood, or certainly
should have been greatly astonished. But things that daily
present themselves to our own observation we despise, not
because they are really less marvellous, but because they are
common; so that even some products of India itself, remote
as it is from ourselves, cease to excite our admiration as soon
as we can admire them at our leisure.<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id="FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

<p>The diamond is a stone possessed by many among ourselves,
especially by jewellers and lapidaries, and the stone is so hard
that it can be wrought neither by iron nor fire, nor, they say,
by anything at all except goat's blood. But do you suppose
it is as much admired by those who own it and are familiar
with its properties as by those to whom it is shown for the
first time? Persons who have not seen it perhaps do not
believe what is said of it, or if they do, they wonder as at a
thing beyond their experience; and if they happen to see it,
still they marvel because they are unused to it, but gradually
familiar experience [of it] dulls their admiration. We know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[Pg 420]</a></span>
that the loadstone has a wonderful power of attracting iron.
When I first saw it I was thunderstruck, for I saw an iron
ring attracted and suspended by the stone; and then, as if it
had communicated its own property to the iron it attracted,
and had made it a substance like itself, this ring was put
near another, and lifted it up; and as the first ring clung to
the magnet, so did the second ring to the first. A third and a
fourth were similarly added, so that there hung from the stone
a kind of chain of rings, with their hoops connected, not interlinking,
but attached together by their outer surface. Who
would not be amazed at this virtue of the stone, subsisting as
it does not only in itself, but transmitted through so many
suspended rings, and binding them together by invisible links?
Yet far more astonishing is what I heard about this stone
from my brother in the episcopate, Severus bishop of Milevis.
He told me that Bathanarius, once count of Africa, when the
bishop was dining with him, produced a magnet, and held it
under a silver plate on which he placed a bit of iron; then as
he moved his hand with the magnet underneath the plate, the
iron upon the plate moved about accordingly. The intervening
silver was not affected at all, but precisely as the magnet
was moved backwards and forwards below it, no matter how
quickly, so was the iron attracted above. I have related what
I myself have witnessed; I have related what I was told by
one whom I trust as I trust my own eyes. Let me further
say what I have read about this magnet. When a diamond
is laid near it, it does not lift iron; or if it has already lifted
it, as soon as the diamond approaches, it drops it. These
stones come from India. But if we cease to admire them
because they are now familiar, how much less must they
admire them who procure them very easily and send them
to us? Perhaps they are held as cheap as we hold lime,
which, because it is common, we think nothing of, though it
has the strange property of burning when water, which is
wont to quench fire, is poured on it, and of remaining cool
when mixed with oil, which ordinarily feeds fire.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>That there are many things which reason cannot account for, and which
are nevertheless true.</i></p>

<p>Nevertheless, when we declare the miracles which God has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[Pg 421]</a></span>
wrought, or will yet work, and which we cannot bring under
the very eyes of men, sceptics keep demanding that we shall
explain these marvels to reason. And because we cannot do
so, inasmuch as they are above human comprehension, they
suppose we are speaking falsely. These persons themselves,
therefore, ought to account for all these marvels which we
either can or do see. And if they perceive that this is impossible
for man to do, they should acknowledge that it cannot
be concluded that a thing has not been or shall not be because
it cannot be reconciled to reason, since there are things now
in existence of which the same is true. I will not, then,
detail the multitude of marvels which are related in books,
and which refer not to things that happened once and passed
away, but that are permanent in certain places, where, if any
one has the desire and opportunity, he may ascertain their
truth; but a few only I recount. The following are some of
the marvels men tell us:&mdash;The salt of Agrigentum in Sicily,
when thrown into the fire, becomes fluid as if it were in
water, but in the water it crackles as if it were in the
fire. The Garamant√¶ have a fountain so cold by day that
no one can drink it, so hot by night no one can touch it.<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id="FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class="fnanchor">[860]</a>
In Epirus, too, there is a fountain which, like all others,
quenches lighted torches, but, unlike all others, lights quenched
torches. There is a stone found in Arcadia, and called asbestos,
because once lit it cannot be put out. The wood of a certain
kind of Egyptian fig-tree sinks in water, and does not float
like other wood; and, stranger still, when it has been sunk
to the bottom for some time, it rises again to the surface,
though nature requires that when soaked in water it should
be heavier than ever. Then there are the apples of Sodom,
which grow indeed to an appearance of ripeness, but, when
you touch them with hand or tooth, the peel cracks, and they
crumble into dust and ashes. The Persian stone pyrites burns
the hand when it is tightly held in it, and so gets its name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[Pg 422]</a></span>
from fire. In Persia, too, there is found another stone called
selenite, because its interior brilliancy waxes and wanes with
the moon. Then in Cappadocia the mares are impregnated
by the wind, and their foals live only three years. Tilon,
an Indian island, has this advantage over all other lands,
that no tree which grows in it ever loses its foliage.</p>

<p>These and numberless other marvels recorded in the history,
not of past events, but of permanent localities, I have no time
to enlarge upon and diverge from my main object; but let
those sceptics who refuse to credit the divine writings give
me, if they can, a rational account of them. For their only
ground of unbelief in the Scriptures is, that they contain
incredible things, just such as I have been recounting. For,
say they, reason cannot admit that flesh burn and remain
unconsumed, suffer without dying. Mighty reasoners, indeed,
who are competent to give the reason of all the marvels that
exist! Let them then give us the reason of the few things
we have cited, and which, if they did not know they existed,
and were only assured by us they would at some future time
occur, they would believe still less than that which they now
refuse to credit on our word. For which of them would
believe us if, instead of saying that the living bodies of men
hereafter will be such as to endure everlasting pain and fire
without ever dying, we were to say that in the world to come
there will be salt which becomes liquid in fire as if it were
in water, and crackles in water as if it were in fire; or that
there will be a fountain whose water in the chill air of night
is so hot that it cannot be touched, while in the heat of day
it is so cold that it cannot be drunk; or that there will be a
stone which by its own heat burns the hand when tightly
held, or a stone which cannot be extinguished if it has been
lit in any part; or any of those wonders I have cited, while
omitting numberless others? If we were to say that these
things would be found in the world to come, and our sceptics
were to reply, "If you wish us to believe these things, satisfy
our reason about each of them," we should confess that we
could not, because the frail comprehension of man cannot
master these and such-like wonders of God's working; and
that yet our reason was thoroughly convinced that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[Pg 423]</a></span>
Almighty does nothing without reason, though the frail
mind of man cannot explain the reason; and that while we
are in many instances uncertain what He intends, yet that it
is always most certain that nothing which He intends is impossible
to Him; and that when He declares His mind, we
believe Him whom we cannot believe to be either powerless
or false. Nevertheless these cavillers at faith and exactors
of reason, how do they dispose of those things of which a reason
cannot be given, and which yet exist, though in apparent contrariety
to the nature of things? If we had announced that
these things were to be, these sceptics would have demanded
from us the reason of them, as they do in the case of those
things which we are announcing as destined to be. And consequently,
as these present marvels are not non-existent, though
human reason and discourse are lost in such works of God, so
those things we speak of are not impossible because inexplicable;
for in this particular they are in the same predicament
as the marvels of earth.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>That all marvels are not of nature's production, but that some are due to
human ingenuity and others to diabolic contrivance.</i></p>

<p>At this point they will perhaps reply, "These things have
no existence; we don't believe one of them; they are travellers'
tales and fictitious romances;" and they may add what has
the appearance of argument, and say, "If you believe such
things as these, believe what is recorded in the same books,
that there was or is a temple of Venus in which a candelabrum
set in the open air holds a lamp, which burns so strongly
that no storm or rain extinguishes it, and which is therefore
called, like the stone mentioned above, the asbestos or inextinguishable
lamp." They may say this with the intention of
putting us into a dilemma: for if we say this is incredible,
then we shall impugn the truth of the other recorded marvels;
if, on the other hand, we admit that this is credible, we shall
avouch the pagan deities. But, as I have already said in the
eighteenth book of this work, we do not hold it necessary to
believe all that profane history contains, since, as Varro says,
even historians themselves disagree on so many points, that
one would think they intended and were at pains to do so;
but we believe, if we are disposed, those things which are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[Pg 424]</a></span>
contradicted by these books, which we do not hesitate to say
we <i>are</i> bound to believe. But as to those permanent miracles
of nature, whereby we wish to persuade the sceptical of the
miracles of the world to come, those are quite sufficient for
our purpose which we ourselves can observe, or of which it is
not difficult to find trustworthy witnesses. Moreover, that
temple of Venus, with its inextinguishable lamp, so far from
hemming us into a corner, opens an advantageous field to
our argument. For to this inextinguishable lamp we add a
host of marvels wrought by men, or by magic,&mdash;that is, by
men under the influence of devils, or by the devils directly,&mdash;for
such marvels we cannot deny without impugning the truth
of the sacred Scriptures we believe. That lamp, therefore,
was either by some mechanical and human device fitted with
asbestos, or it was arranged by magical art in order that the
worshippers might be astonished, or some devil under the
name of Venus so signally manifested himself that this prodigy
both began and became permanent. Now devils are attracted to
dwell in certain temples by means of the creatures (God's creatures,
not theirs), who present to them what suits their various
tastes. They are attracted not by food like animals, but, like
spirits, by such symbols as suit their taste, various kinds of
stones, woods, plants, animals, songs, rites. And that men
may provide these attractions, the devils first of all cunningly
seduce them, either by imbuing their hearts with a secret
poison, or by revealing themselves under a friendly guise, and
thus make a few of them their disciples, who become the instructors
of the multitude. For unless they first instructed men,
it were impossible to know what each of them desires, what
they shrink from, by what name they should be invoked or
constrained to be present. Hence the origin of magic and
magicians. But, above all, they possess the hearts of men, and
are chiefly proud of this possession when they transform themselves
into angels of light. Very many things that occur,
therefore, are their doing; and these deeds of theirs we ought
all the more carefully to shun as we acknowledge them to be
very surprising. And yet these very deeds forward my present
arguments. For if such marvels are wrought by unclean
devils, how much mightier are the holy angels! and what cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[Pg 425]</a></span>
that God do who made the angels themselves capable of
working miracles!</p>

<p>If, then, very many effects can be contrived by human art,
of so surprising a kind that the uninitiated think them divine,
as when, <i>e.g.</i>, in a certain temple two magnets have been adjusted,
one in the roof, another in the floor, so that an iron
image is suspended in mid-air between them, one would suppose
by the power of the divinity, were he ignorant of the
magnets above and beneath; or, as in the case of that lamp of
Venus which we already mentioned as being a skilful adaptation
of asbestos; if, again, by the help of magicians, whom Scripture
calls sorcerers and enchanters, the devils could gain such
power that the noble poet Virgil should consider himself justified
in describing a very powerful magician in these lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Her charms can cure what souls she please,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Rob other hearts of healthful ease,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Turn rivers backward to their source,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And make the stars forget their course,<br /></span>
<span class="i7">And call up ghosts from night:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The ground shall bellow 'neath your feet:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The mountain-ash shall quit its seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i7">And travel down the height;"<a name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">[861]</a>&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>if this be so, how much more able is God to do those things
which to sceptics are incredible, but to His power easy, since
it is He who has given to stones and all other things their
virtue, and to men their skill to use them in wonderful ways;
He who has given to the angels a nature more mighty than
that of all that lives on earth; He whose power surpasses all
marvels, and whose wisdom in working, ordaining, and permitting
is no less marvellous in its governance of all things
than in its creation of all!</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>That the ultimate reason for believing miracles is the omnipotence of the
Creator.</i></p>

<p>Why, then, cannot God effect both that the bodies of the
dead shall rise, and that the bodies of the damned shall be
tormented in everlasting fire,&mdash;God, who made the world full
of countless miracles in sky, earth, air, and waters, while itself
is a miracle unquestionably greater and more admirable than
all the marvels it is filled with? But those with whom or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[Pg 426]</a></span>
against whom we are arguing, who believe both that there is
a God who made the world, and that there are gods created
by Him who administer the world's laws as His vicegerents,&mdash;our
adversaries, I say, who, so far from denying emphatically,
assert that there are powers in the world which effect marvellous
results (whether of their own accord, or because they
are invoked by some rite or prayer, or in some magical way),
when we lay before them the wonderful properties of other
things which are neither rational animals nor rational spirits,
but such material objects as those we have just cited, are
in the habit of replying, This is their natural property, their
nature; these are the powers naturally belonging to them.
Thus the whole reason why Agrigentine salt dissolves in fire
and crackles in water is that this is its nature. Yet this seems
rather contrary to nature, which has given not to fire but to
water the power of melting salt, and the power of scorching it
not to water but to fire. But this, they say, is the natural
property of <i>this</i> salt, to show effects contrary to these. The
same reason, therefore, is assigned to account for that Garamantian
fountain, of which one and the same runlet is chill
by day and boiling by night, so that in either extreme it cannot
be touched. So also of that other fountain which, though
it is cold to the touch, and though it, like other fountains,
extinguishes a lighted torch, yet, unlike other fountains, and
in a surprising manner, kindles an extinguished torch. So of
the asbestos stone, which, though it has no heat of its own, yet
when kindled by fire applied to it, cannot be extinguished.
And so of the rest, which I am weary of reciting, and in which,
though there seems to be an extraordinary property contrary
to nature, yet no other reason is given for them than this, that
this is their nature,&mdash;a brief reason truly, and, I own, a satisfactory
reply. But since God is the author of all natures,
how is it that our adversaries, when they refuse to believe
what we affirm, on the ground that it is impossible, are unwilling
to accept from us a better explanation than their own,
viz. that this is the will of Almighty God,&mdash;for certainly He
is called Almighty only because He is mighty to do all He
will,&mdash;He who was able to create so many marvels, not only
unknown, but very well ascertained, as I have been showing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[Pg 427]</a></span>
and which, were they not under our own observation, or reported
by recent and credible witnesses, would certainly be
pronounced impossible? For as for those marvels which have
no other testimony than the writers in whose books we read
them, and who wrote without being divinely instructed, and are
therefore liable to human error, we cannot justly blame any
one who declines to believe them.</p>

<p>For my own part, I do not wish all the marvels I have
cited to be rashly accepted, for I do not myself believe them
implicitly, save those which have either come under my own
observation, or which any one can readily verify,&mdash;such as the
lime which is heated by water and cooled by oil; the magnet
which by its mysterious and insensible suction attracts the
iron, but has no effect on a straw; the peacock's flesh which
triumphs over the corruption from which not the flesh of
Plato is exempt; the chaff so chilling that it prevents snow
from melting, so heating that it forces apples to ripen; the
glowing fire, which, in accordance with its glowing appearance,
whitens the stones it bakes, while, contrary to its glowing
appearance, it begrimes most things it burns (just as dirty
stains are made by oil, however pure it be, and as the lines
drawn by white silver are black); the charcoal, too, which by
the action of fire is so completely changed from its original,
that a finely marked piece of wood becomes hideous, the tough
becomes brittle, the decaying incorruptible. Some of these
things I know in common with many other persons, some of
them in common with all men; and there are many others
which I have not room to insert in this book. But of those
which I have cited, though I have not myself seen, but only
read about them, I have been unable to find trustworthy witnesses
from whom I could ascertain whether they are facts,
except in the case of that fountain in which burning torches
are extinguished and extinguished torches lit, and of the
apples of Sodom, which are ripe to appearance, but are filled
with dust. And indeed I have not met with any who said
they had seen that fountain in Epirus, but with some who
knew there was a similar fountain in Gaul not far from
Grenoble. The fruit of the trees of Sodom, however, is not
only spoken of in books worthy of credit, but so many persons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[Pg 428]</a></span>
say that they have seen it that I cannot doubt the fact.
But the rest of the prodigies I receive without definitely
affirming or denying them; and I have cited them because I
read them in the authors of our adversaries, and that I might
prove how many things many among themselves believe, because
they are written in the works of their own literary men,
though no rational explanation of them is given, and yet they
scorn to believe us when we assert that Almighty God will do
what is beyond their experience and observation; and this they
do even though we assign a reason for His work. For what
better and stronger reason for such things can be given than
to say that the Almighty is able to bring them to pass, and
will bring them to pass, having predicted them in those books
in which many other marvels which have already come to
pass were predicted? Those things which are regarded as
impossible will be accomplished according to the word, and by
the power of that God who predicted and effected that the
incredulous nations should believe incredible wonders.</p>

<p>8. <i>That it is not contrary to nature that, in an object whose nature is known,
there should be discovered an alteration of the properties which have been
known as its natural properties.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But if they reply that their reason for not believing us
when we say that human bodies will always burn and yet never
die, is that the nature of human bodies is known to be quite
otherwise constituted; if they say that for this miracle we
cannot give the reason which was valid in the case of those
natural miracles, viz. that this is the natural property, the
nature of the thing,&mdash;for we know that this is not the nature
of human flesh,&mdash;we find our answer in the sacred writings,
that even this human flesh was constituted in one fashion
before there was sin,&mdash;was constituted, in fact, so that it
could not die,&mdash;and in another fashion after sin, being made
such as we see it in this miserable state of mortality, unable
to retain enduring life. And so in the resurrection of the
dead shall it be constituted differently from its present well-known
condition. But as they do not believe these writings
of ours, in which we read what nature man had in paradise,
and how remote he was from the necessity of death,&mdash;and
indeed, if they did believe them, we should of course have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[Pg 429]</a></span>
little trouble in debating with them the future punishment
of the damned,&mdash;we must produce from the writings of their
own most learned authorities some instances to show that it
is possible for a thing to become different from what it was
formerly known characteristically to be.</p>

<p>From the book of Marcus Varro, entitled, <i>Of the Race Of
the Roman People</i>, I cite word for word the following instance:
"There occurred a remarkable celestial portent; for
Castor records that, in the brilliant star Venus, called Vesperugo
by Plautus, and the lovely Hesperus by Homer, there
occurred so strange a prodigy, that it changed its colour, size,
form, course, which never happened before nor since. Adrastus
of Cyzicus, and Dion of Naples, famous mathematicians, said
that this occurred in the reign of Ogyges." So great an
author as Varro would certainly not have called this a portent
had it not seemed to be contrary to nature. For we say
that all portents are contrary to nature; but they are not so.
For how is that contrary to nature which happens by the
will of God, since the will of so mighty a Creator is certainly
the nature of each created thing? A portent, therefore, happens
not contrary to nature, but contrary to what we know as
nature. But who can number the multitude of portents
recorded in profane histories? Let us then at present fix
our attention on this one only which concerns the matter in
hand. What is there so arranged by the Author of the nature
of heaven and earth as the exactly ordered course of the
stars? What is there established by laws so sure and inflexible?
And yet, when it pleased Him who with sovereignty
and supreme power regulates all He has created, a
star conspicuous among the rest by its size and splendour
changed its colour, size, form, and, most wonderful of all, the
order and law of its course! Certainly that phenomenon
disturbed the canons of the astronomers, if there were any
then, by which they tabulate, as by unerring computation, the
past and future movements of the stars, so as to take upon
them to affirm that this which happened to the morning star
(Venus) never happened before nor since. But we read in
the divine books that even the sun itself stood still when a
holy man, Joshua the son of Nun, had begged this from God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[Pg 430]</a></span>
until victory should finish the battle he had begun; and that
it even went back, that the promise of fifteen years added to
the life of king Hezekiah might be sealed by this additional
prodigy. But these miracles, which were vouchsafed to the
merits of holy men, even when our adversaries believe them,
they attribute to magical arts; so Virgil, in the lines I quoted
above, ascribes to magic the power to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Turn rivers backward to their source,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And make the stars forget their course."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>For in our sacred books we read that this also happened,
that a river "turned backward," was stayed above while the
lower part flowed on, when the people passed over under the
above-mentioned leader, Joshua the son of Nun; and also when
Elias the prophet crossed; and afterwards, when his disciple
Elisha passed through it: and we have just mentioned how,
in the case of king Hezekiah, the greatest of the "stars forgot
its course." But what happened to Venus, according to Varro,
was not said by him to have happened in answer to any man's
prayer.</p>

<p>Let not the sceptics then benight themselves in this knowledge
of the nature of things, as if divine power cannot
bring to pass in an object anything else than what their own
experience has shown them to be in its nature. Even the
very things which are most commonly known as natural
would not be less wonderful nor less effectual to excite surprise
in all who beheld them, if men were not accustomed to
admire nothing but what is rare. For who that thoughtfully
observes the countless multitude of men, and their similarity
of nature, can fail to remark with surprise and admiration the
individuality of each man's appearance, suggesting to us, as it
does, that unless men were like one another, they would not
be distinguished from the rest of the animals; while unless,
on the other hand, they were unlike, they could not be distinguished
from one another, so that those whom we declare
to be like, we also find to be unlike? And the unlikeness is
the more wonderful consideration of the two; for a common
nature seems rather to require similarity. And yet, because
the very rarity of things is that which makes them wonderful,
we are filled with much greater wonder when we are introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[Pg 431]</a></span>
to two men so like, that we either always or frequently
mistake in endeavouring to distinguish between them.</p>

<p>But possibly, though Varro is a heathen historian, and a
very learned one, they may disbelieve that what I have cited
from him truly occurred; or they may say the example is invalid,
because the star did not for any length of time continue
to follow its new course, but returned to its ordinary orbit.
There is, then, another phenomenon at present open to their
observation, and which, in my opinion, ought to be sufficient
to convince them that, though they have observed and ascertained
some natural law, they ought not on that account
to prescribe to God, as if He could not change and turn it
into something very different from what they have observed.
The land of Sodom was not always as it now is; but once
it had the appearance of other lands, and enjoyed equal if
not richer fertility; for, in the divine narrative, it was compared
to the paradise of God. But after it was touched [by
fire] from heaven, as even pagan history testifies, and as is
now witnessed by those who visit the spot, it became unnaturally
and horribly sooty in appearance; and its apples,
under a deceitful appearance of ripeness, contain ashes within.
Here is a thing which was of one kind, and is of another.
You see how its nature was converted by the wonderful
transmutation wrought by the Creator of all natures into so
very disgusting a diversity,&mdash;an alteration which after so long
a time took place, and after so long a time still continues.</p>

<p>As therefore it was not impossible to God to create such
natures as He pleased, so it is not impossible to Him to
change these natures of His own creation into whatever He
pleases, and thus spread abroad a multitude of those marvels
which are called monsters, portents, prodigies, phenomena,<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">[862]</a>
and which if I were minded to cite and record, what end
would there be to this work? They say that they are called
"monsters," because they <i>demonstrate</i> or signify something;
"portents," because they <i>portend</i> something; and so forth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[Pg 432]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_863_863" id="FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class="fnanchor">[863]</a>
But let their diviners see how they are either deceived, or
even when they do predict true things, it is because they
are inspired by spirits, who are intent upon entangling the
minds of men (worthy, indeed, of such a fate) in the meshes
of a hurtful curiosity, or how they light now and then upon
some truth, because they make so many predictions. Yet,
for our part, these things which happen contrary to nature,
and are said to be contrary to nature (as the apostle, speaking
after the manner of men, says, that to graff the wild olive
into the good olive, and to partake of its fatness, is contrary
to nature), and are called monsters, phenomena, portents, prodigies,
ought to demonstrate, portend, predict that God will
bring to pass what He has foretold regarding the bodies of
men, no difficulty preventing Him, no law of nature prescribing
to Him His limit. How He has foretold what He
is to do, I think I have sufficiently shown in the preceding
book, culling from the sacred Scriptures, both of the New and
Old Testaments, not, indeed, all the passages that relate to
this, but as many as I judged to suffice for this work.</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>Of hell, and the nature of eternal punishments.</i></p>

<p>So then what God by His prophet has said of the everlasting
punishment of the damned shall come to pass&mdash;shall
without fail come to pass,&mdash;"their worm shall not die, neither
shall their fire be quenched."<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">[864]</a> In order to impress this upon
us most forcibly, the Lord Jesus Himself, when ordering us to
cut off our members, meaning thereby those persons whom a
man loves as the most useful members of his body, says, "It
is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than having two
hands to go into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched;
where their worm dieth not, and their fire is not quenched."
Similarly of the foot: "It is better for thee to enter halt into
life, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire
that never shall be quenched; where their worm dieth not,
and the fire is not quenched." So, too, of the eye: "It is
better for thee to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye,
than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire; where their
worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched."<a name="FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">[865]</a> He did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[Pg 433]</a></span>
shrink from using the same words three times over in one
passage. And who is not terrified by this repetition, and by
the threat of that punishment uttered so vehemently by the
lips of the Lord Himself?</p>

<p>Now they who would refer both the fire and the worm to
the spirit, and not to the body, affirm that the wicked, who are
separated from the kingdom of God, shall be burned, as it were,
by the anguish of a spirit repenting too late and fruitlessly;
and they contend that fire is therefore not inappropriately used
to express this burning torment, as when the apostle exclaims,
"Who is offended, and I burn not?"<a name="FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">[866]</a> The worm, too, they
think, is to be similarly understood. For it is written, they
say, "As the moth consumes the garment, and the worm the
wood, so does grief consume the heart of a man."<a name="FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">[867]</a> But they
who make no doubt that in that future punishment both body
and soul shall suffer, affirm that the body shall be burned with
fire, while the soul shall be, as it were, gnawed by a worm of
anguish. Though this view is more reasonable,&mdash;for it is absurd
to suppose that either body or soul will escape pain in the
future punishment,&mdash;yet, for my own part, I find it easier to
understand both as referring to the body than to suppose that
neither does; and I think that Scripture is silent regarding
the spiritual pain of the damned, because, though not expressed,
it is necessarily understood that in a body thus tormented the
soul also is tortured with a fruitless repentance. For we read
in the ancient Scriptures, "The vengeance of the flesh of the
ungodly is fire and worms."<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id="FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class="fnanchor">[868]</a> It might have been more briefly
said, "The vengeance of the ungodly." Why, then, was it said,
"The flesh of the ungodly," unless because both the fire and
the worm are to be the punishment of the flesh? Or if the
object of the writer in saying, "The vengeance of the flesh,"
was to indicate that this shall be the punishment of those who
live after the flesh (for this leads to the second death, as the
apostle intimated when he said, "For if ye live after the flesh,
ye shall die"<a name="FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">[869]</a>), let each one make his own choice, either
assigning the fire to the body and the worm to the soul,&mdash;the
one figuratively, the other really,&mdash;or assigning both really to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[Pg 434]</a></span>
the body. For I have already sufficiently made out that
animals can live in the fire, in burning without being consumed,
in pain without dying, by a miracle of the most omnipotent
Creator, to whom no one can deny that this is possible, if
he be not ignorant by whom has been made all that is wonderful
in all nature. For it is God Himself who has wrought all
these miracles, great and small, in this world which I have
mentioned, and incomparably more which I have omitted, and
who has enclosed these marvels in this world, itself the greatest
miracle of all. Let each man, then, choose which he will,
whether he thinks that the worm is real and pertains to the
body, or that spiritual things are meant by bodily representations,
and that it belongs to the soul. But which of these is
true will be more readily discovered by the facts themselves,
when there shall be in the saints such knowledge as shall not
require that their own experience teach them the nature of
these punishments, but as shall, by its own fulness and perfection,
suffice to instruct them in this matter. For "now we
know in part, until that which is perfect is come;"<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id="FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class="fnanchor">[870]</a> only, this
we believe about those future bodies, that they shall be such
as shall certainly be pained by the fire.</p>


<p class="center">10. <i>Whether the fire of hell, if it be material fire, can burn the wicked spirits,
that is to say, devils, who are immaterial.</i></p>

<p>Here arises the question: If the fire is not to be immaterial,
analogous to the pain of the soul, but material, burning by
contact, so that bodies may be tormented in it, how can evil
spirits be punished in it? For it is undoubtedly the same
fire which is to serve for the punishment of men and of devils,
according to the words of Christ: "Depart from me, ye cursed,
into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels;"<a name="FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">[871]</a>
unless, perhaps, as learned men have thought, the devils have
a kind of body made of that dense and humid air which we
feel strikes us when the wind is blowing. And if this kind
of substance could not be affected by fire, it could not burn
when heated in the baths. For in order to burn, it is first
burned, and affects other things as itself is affected. But if
any one maintains that the devils have no bodies, this is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[Pg 435]</a></span>
a matter either to be laboriously investigated, or to be debated
with keenness. For why may we not assert that even immaterial
spirits may, in some extraordinary way, yet really be
pained by the punishment of material fire, if the spirits of
men, which also are certainly immaterial, are both now contained
in material members of the body, and in the world to
come shall be indissolubly united to their own bodies? Therefore,
though the devils have no bodies, yet their spirits, that
is, the devils themselves, shall be brought into thorough contact
with the material fires, to be tormented by them; not
that the fires themselves with which they are brought into
contact shall be animated by their connection with these spirits,
and become animals composed of body and spirit, but, as I
said, this junction will be effected in a wonderful and ineffable
way, so that they shall receive pain from the fires, but give no
life to them. And, in truth, this other mode of union, by
which bodies and spirits are bound together and become
animals, is thoroughly marvellous, and beyond the comprehension
of man, though this it is which is man.</p>

<p>I would indeed say that these spirits will burn without any
body of their own, as that rich man was burning in hell when
he exclaimed, "I am tormented in this flame,"<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id="FNanchor_872_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872_872" class="fnanchor">[872]</a> were I not
aware that it is aptly said in reply, that that flame was of the
same nature as the eyes he raised and fixed on Lazarus, as the
tongue on which he entreated that a little cooling water might
be dropped, or as the finger of Lazarus, with which he asked
that this might be done,&mdash;all of which took place where souls
exist without bodies. Thus, therefore, both that flame in
which he burned and that drop he begged were immaterial,
and resembled the visions of sleepers or persons in an ecstasy,
to whom immaterial objects appear in a bodily form. For the
man himself who is in such a state, though it be in spirit
only, not in body, yet sees himself so like to his own body
that he cannot discern any difference whatever. But that
hell, which also is called a lake of fire and brimstone,<a name="FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">[873]</a> will be
material fire, and will torment the bodies of the damned,
whether men or devils,&mdash;the solid bodies of the one, aerial
bodies of the others; or if only men have bodies as well as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">[Pg 436]</a></span>
souls, yet the evil spirits, though without bodies, shall be so
connected with the bodily fires as to receive pain without
imparting life. One fire certainly shall be the lot of both,
for thus the truth has declared.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Whether it is just that the punishments of sins last longer than the sins
themselves lasted.</i></p>

<p>Some, however, of those against whom we are defending the
city of God, think it unjust that any man be doomed to an
eternal punishment for sins which, no matter how great they
were, were perpetrated in a brief space of time; as if any law
ever regulated the duration of the punishment by the duration
of the offence punished! Cicero tells us that the laws recognise
eight kinds of penalty,&mdash;damages, imprisonment, scourging,
reparation,<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">[874]</a> disgrace, exile, death, slavery. Is there any one
of these which may be compressed into a brevity proportioned
to the rapid commission of the offence, so that no longer time
may be spent in its punishment than in its perpetration, unless,
perhaps, reparation? For this requires that the offender
suffer what he did, as that clause of the law says, "Eye for
eye, tooth for tooth."<a name="FNanchor_875_875" id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class="fnanchor">[875]</a> For certainly it is possible for an
offender to lose his eye by the severity of legal retaliation in
as brief a time as he deprived another of his eye by the
cruelty of his own lawlessness. But if scourging be a reasonable
penalty for kissing another man's wife, is not the fault
of an instant visited with long hours of atonement, and the
momentary delight punished with lasting pain? What shall
we say of imprisonment? Must the criminal be confined only
for so long a time as he spent on the offence for which he is
committed? or is not a penalty of many years' confinement
imposed on the slave who has provoked his master with a
word, or has struck him a blow that is quickly over? And
as to damages, disgrace, exile, slavery, which are commonly
inflicted so as to admit of no relaxation or pardon, do not these
resemble eternal punishments in so far as this short life allows
a resemblance? For they are not eternal only because the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">[Pg 437]</a></span>
life in which they are endured is not eternal; and yet the
crimes which are punished with these most protracted sufferings
are perpetrated in a very brief space of time. Nor is
there any one who would suppose that the pains of punishment
should occupy as short a time as the offence; or that
murder, adultery, sacrilege, or any other crime, should be
measured, not by the enormity of the injury or wickedness,
but by the length of time spent in its perpetration. Then as
to the award of death for any great crime, do the laws reckon
the punishment to consist in the brief moment in which death
is inflicted, or in this, that the offender is eternally banished
from the society of the living? And just as the punishment
of the first death cuts men off from this present mortal city,
so does the punishment of the second death cut men off from
that future immortal city. For as the laws of this present
city do not provide for the executed criminal's return to it, so
neither is he who is condemned to the second death recalled
again to life everlasting. But if temporal sin is visited with
eternal punishment, how, then, they say, is that true which
your Christ says, "With the same measure that ye mete
withal it shall be measured to you again?"<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id="FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class="fnanchor">[876]</a> and they do not
observe that "the same measure" refers, not to an equal space
of time, but to the retribution of evil, or, in other words, to
the law by which he who has done evil suffers evil. Besides,
these words could be appropriately understood as referring to
the matter of which our Lord was speaking when He used
them, viz. judgments and condemnation. Thus, if he who
unjustly judges and condemns is himself justly judged and
condemned, he receives "with the same measure" though not
the same thing as he gave. For judgment he gave, and judgment
he receives, though the judgment he gave was unjust,
the judgment he receives just.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>12. <i>Of the greatness of the first transgression, on account of which eternal
punishment is due to all who are not within the pale of the Saviour's
grace.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But eternal punishment seems hard and unjust to human
perceptions, because in the weakness of our mortal condition
there is wanting that highest and purest wisdom by which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[Pg 438]</a></span>
can be perceived how great a wickedness was committed in
that first transgression. The more enjoyment man found in
God, the greater was his wickedness in abandoning Him;
and he who destroyed in himself a good which might have
been eternal, became worthy of eternal evil. Hence the
whole mass of the human race is condemned; for he who at
first gave entrance to sin has been punished with all his posterity
who were in him as in a root, so that no one is exempt
from this just and due punishment, unless delivered by mercy
and undeserved grace; and the human race is so apportioned
that in some is displayed the efficacy of merciful grace, in the
rest the efficacy of just retribution. For both could not be
displayed in all; for if all had remained<a name="FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">[877]</a> under the punishment
of just condemnation, there would have been seen in no
one the mercy of redeeming grace. And, on the other hand, if
all had been transferred from darkness to light, the severity of
retribution would have been manifested in none. But many
more are left under punishment than are delivered from it, in
order that it may thus be shown what was due to all. And
had it been inflicted on all, no one could justly have found
fault with the justice of Him who taketh vengeance; whereas,
in the deliverance of so many from that just award, there is
cause to render the most cordial thanks to the gratuitous
bounty of Him who delivers.</p>

<p>They who are of this opinion would have all punishments
after death to be purgatorial; and as the elements of air, fire,
and water are superior to earth, one or other of these may be
the instrument of expiating and purging away the stain contracted
by the contagion of earth. So Virgil hints at the air
in the words, "Some hang aloft for winds to pierce;" at the
water in "whelming tide;" and at fire in the expression "in
burning fire." For our part, we recognise that even in this
life some punishments are purgatorial,&mdash;not, indeed, to those
whose life is none the better, but rather the worse for them,
but to those who are constrained by them to amend their life.
All other punishments, whether temporal or eternal, inflicted
as they are on every one by divine providence, are sent either
on account of past sins, or of sins presently allowed in the
life, or to exercise and reveal a man's graces. They may be
inflicted by the instrumentality of bad men and angels as well
as of the good. For even if any one suffers some hurt through
another's wickedness or mistake, the man indeed sins whose
ignorance or injustice does the harm; but God, who by His
just though hidden judgment permits it to be done, sins not.
But temporary punishments are suffered by some in this life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[Pg 440]</a></span>
only, by others after death, by others both now and then; but
all of them before that last and strictest judgment. But of
those who suffer temporary punishments after death, all are
not doomed to those everlasting pains which are to follow
that judgment; for to some, as we have already said, what
is not remitted in this world is remitted in the next, that is,
they are not punished with the eternal punishment of the
world to come.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Of the temporary punishments of this life to which the human condition
is subject.</i></p>

<p>Quite exceptional are those who are not punished in this
life, but only afterwards. Yet that there have been some
who have reached the decrepitude of age without experiencing
even the slightest sickness, and who have had uninterrupted
enjoyment of life, I know both from report and from my own
observation. However, the very life we mortals lead is itself
all punishment, for it is all temptation, as the Scriptures
declare, where it is written, "Is not the life of man upon
earth a temptation?"<a name="FNanchor_880_880" id="FNanchor_880_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880_880" class="fnanchor">[880]</a> For ignorance is itself no slight
punishment, or want of culture, which it is with justice
thought so necessary to escape, that boys are compelled, under
pain of severe punishment, to learn trades or letters; and the
learning to which they are driven by punishment is itself so
much of a punishment to them, that they sometimes prefer the
pain that drives them to the pain to which they are driven by
it. And who would not shrink from the alternative, and
elect to die, if it were proposed to him either to suffer death
or to be again an infant? Our infancy, indeed, introducing
us to this life not with laughter but with tears, seems unconsciously
to predict the ills we are to encounter.<a name="FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">[881]</a> Zoroaster
alone is said to have laughed when he was born, and that
unnatural omen portended no good to him. For he is said to
have been the inventor of magical arts, though indeed they
were unable to secure to him even the poor felicity of this
present life against the assaults of his enemies. For, himself
king of the Bactrians, he was conquered by Ninus king of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[Pg 441]</a></span>
Assyrians. In short, the words of Scripture, "An heavy yoke
is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of
their mother's womb till the day that they return to the
mother of all things,"<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id="FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class="fnanchor">[882]</a>&mdash;these words so infallibly find fulfilment,
that even the little ones, who by the laver of regeneration
have been freed from the bond of original sin in which
alone they were held, yet suffer many ills, and in some instances
are even exposed to the assaults of evil spirits. But
let us not for a moment suppose that this suffering is prejudicial
to their future happiness, even though it has so increased
as to sever soul from body, and to terminate their life
in that early age.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>15. <i>That everything which the grace of God does in the way of rescuing us from
the inveterate evils in which we are sunk, pertains to the future world, in
which all things are made new.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Nevertheless, in the "heavy yoke that is laid upon the
sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's
womb to the day that they return to the mother of all things,"
there is found an admirable though painful monitor teaching
us to be sober-minded, and convincing us that this life has
become penal in consequence of that outrageous wickedness
which was perpetrated in Paradise, and that all to which the
New Testament invites belongs to that future inheritance
which awaits us in the world to come, and is offered for our
acceptance, as the earnest that we may, in its own due time,
obtain that of which it is the pledge. Now, therefore, let us
walk in hope, and let us by the spirit mortify the deeds of
the flesh, and so make progress from day to day. For "the
Lord knoweth them that are His;"<a name="FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">[883]</a> and "as many as are
led by the Spirit of God, they are sons of God,"<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id="FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class="fnanchor">[884]</a> but by grace,
not by nature. For there is but one Son of God by nature,
who in His compassion became Son of man for our sakes, that
we, by nature sons of men, might by grace become through
Him sons of God. For He, abiding unchangeable, took upon
Him our nature, that thereby He might take us to Himself;
and, holding fast His own divinity, He became partaker of
our infirmity, that we, being changed into some better thing,
might, by participating in His righteousness and immortality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[Pg 442]</a></span>
lose our own properties of sin and mortality, and
preserve whatever good quality He had implanted in our
nature, perfected now by sharing in the goodness of His
nature. For as by the sin of one man we have fallen
into a misery so deplorable, so by the righteousness of one
Man, who also is God, shall we come to a blessedness inconceivably
exalted. Nor ought any one to trust that he has
passed from the one man to the other until he shall have reached
that place where there is no temptation, and have entered
into the peace which he seeks in the many and various conflicts
of this war, in which "the flesh lusteth against the
spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id="FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class="fnanchor">[885]</a> Now, such a war as
this would have had no existence, if human nature had, in
the exercise of free will, continued stedfast in the uprightness
in which it was created. But now in its misery it
makes war upon itself, because in its blessedness it would not
continue at peace with God; and this, though it be a miserable
calamity, is better than the earlier stages of this life,
which do not recognise that a war is to be maintained. For
better is it to contend with vices than without conflict to be
subdued by them. Better, I say, is war with the hope of
peace everlasting than captivity without any thought of deliverance.
We long, indeed, for the cessation of this war, and,
kindled by the flame of divine love, we burn for entrance on
that well-ordered peace in which whatever is inferior is for
ever subordinated to what is above it. But if (which God
forbid) there had been no hope of so blessed a consummation,
we should still have preferred to endure the hardness of this
conflict, rather than, by our non-resistance, to yield ourselves
to the dominion of vice.</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>The laws of grace, which extend to all the epochs of the life of the regenerate.</i></p>

<p>But such is God's mercy towards the vessels of mercy
which He has prepared for glory, that even the first age of
man, that is, infancy, which submits without any resistance to
the flesh, and the second age, which is called boyhood, and
which has not yet understanding enough to undertake this
warfare, and therefore yields to almost every vicious pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[Pg 443]</a></span>
(because though this age has the power of speech,<a name="FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">[886]</a> and may
therefore seem to have passed infancy, the mind is still too
weak to comprehend the commandment), yet if either of these
ages has received the sacraments of the Mediator, then, although
the present life be immediately brought to an end, the child,
having been translated from the power of darkness to the kingdom
of Christ, shall not only be saved from eternal punishments,
but shall not even suffer purgatorial torments after
death. For spiritual regeneration of itself suffices to prevent
any evil consequences resulting after death from the connection
with death which carnal generation forms.<a name="FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">[887]</a> But when
we reach that age which can now comprehend the commandment,
and submit to the dominion of law, we must declare
war upon vices, and wage this war keenly, lest we be landed
in damnable sins. And if vices have not gathered strength,
by habitual victory they are more easily overcome and subdued;
but if they have been used to conquer and rule, it is
only with difficulty and labour they are mastered. And
indeed this victory cannot be sincerely and truly gained but
by delighting in true righteousness, and it is faith in Christ
that gives this. For if the law be present with its command,
and the Spirit be absent with His help, the presence of the
prohibition serves only to increase the desire to sin, and adds
the guilt of transgression. Sometimes, indeed, patent vices
are overcome by other and hidden vices, which are reckoned
virtues, though pride and a kind of ruinous self-sufficiency
are their informing principles. Accordingly vices are then
only to be considered overcome when they are conquered by
the love of God, which God Himself alone gives, and which
He gives only through the Mediator between God and men,
the man Christ Jesus, who became a partaker of our mortality
that He might make us partakers of His divinity. But few
indeed are they who are so happy as to have passed their
youth without committing any damnable sins, either by dissolute
or violent conduct, or by following some godless and
unlawful opinions, but have subdued by their greatness of
soul everything in them which could make them the slaves of
carnal pleasures. The greater number having first become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[Pg 444]</a></span>
transgressors of the law that they have received, and having
allowed vice to have the ascendency in them, then flee to
grace for help, and so, by a penitence more bitter, and a struggle
more violent than it would otherwise have been, they subdue
the soul to God, and thus give it its lawful authority over
the flesh, and become victors. Whoever, therefore, desires to
escape eternal punishment, let him not only be baptized, but
also justified in Christ, and so let him in truth pass from the
devil to Christ. And let him not fancy that there are any
purgatorial pains except before that final and dreadful judgment.
We must not, however, deny that even the eternal
fire will be proportioned to the deserts of the wicked, so that
to some it will be more, and to others less painful, whether
this result be accomplished by a variation in the temperature
of the fire itself, graduated according to every one's merit, or
whether it be that the heat remains the same, but that all do
not feel it with equal intensity of torment.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Of those who fancy that no men shall be punished eternally.</i></p>

<p>I must now, I see, enter the lists of amicable controversy
with those tender-hearted Christians who decline to believe
that any, or that all of those whom the infallibly just Judge
may pronounce worthy of the punishment of hell, shall suffer
eternally, and who suppose that they shall be delivered after
a fixed term of punishment, longer or shorter according to
the amount of each man's sin. In respect of this matter,
Origen was even more indulgent; for he believed that even
the devil himself and his angels, after suffering those more
severe and prolonged pains which their sins deserved, should
be delivered from their torments, and associated with the holy
angels. But the Church, not without reason, condemned him
for this and other errors, especially for his theory of the ceaseless
alternation of happiness and misery, and the interminable
transitions from the one state to the other at fixed periods of
ages; for in this theory he lost even the credit of being merciful,
by allotting to the saints real miseries for the expiation
of their sins, and false happiness, which brought them no true
and secure joy, that is, no fearless assurance of eternal blessedness.
Very different, however, is the error we speak of, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[Pg 445]</a></span>
is dictated by the tenderness of these Christians who suppose
that the sufferings of those who are condemned in the judgment
will be temporary, while the blessedness of all who are
sooner or later set free will be eternal. Which opinion, if it
is good and true because it is merciful, will be so much the
better and truer in proportion as it becomes more merciful.
Let, then, this fountain of mercy be extended, and flow forth
even to the lost angels, and let them also be set free, at least
after as many and long ages as seem fit! Why does this stream
of mercy flow to all the human race, and dry up as soon as
it reaches the angelic? And yet they dare not extend their
pity further, and propose the deliverance of the devil himself.
Or if any one is bold enough to do so, he does indeed put to
shame their charity, but is himself convicted of error that is more
unsightly, and a wresting of God's truth that is more perverse,
in proportion as his clemency of sentiment seems to be greater.<a name="FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">[888]</a></p>


<p class="center">18. <i>Of those who fancy that, on account of the saints' intercession, no man shall
be damned in the last judgment.</i></p>

<p>There are others, again, with whose opinions I have become
acquainted in conversation, who, though they seem to reverence
the holy Scriptures, are yet of reprehensible life, and
who accordingly, in their own interest, attribute to God a still
greater compassion towards men. For they acknowledge that
it is truly predicted in the divine word that the wicked and
unbelieving are worthy of punishment, but they assert that,
when the judgment comes, mercy will prevail. For, say they,
God, having compassion on them, will give them up to the
prayers and intercessions of His saints. For if the saints
used to pray for them when they suffered from their cruel
hatred, how much more will they do so when they see them
prostrate and humble suppliants? For we cannot, they say,
believe that the saints shall lose their bowels of compassion
when they have attained the most perfect and complete holiness;
so that they who, when still sinners, prayed for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[Pg 446]</a></span>
enemies, should now, when they are freed from sin, withhold
from interceding for their suppliants. Or shall God refuse to
listen to so many of His beloved children, when their holiness
has purged their prayers of all hindrance to His answering
them? And the passage of the psalm which is cited by those
who admit that wicked men and infidels shall be punished for
a long time, though in the end delivered from all sufferings,
is claimed also by the persons we are now speaking of as
making much more for them. The verse runs: "Shall God
forget to be gracious? Shall He in anger shut up His tender
mercies?"<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id="FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class="fnanchor">[889]</a> His anger, they say, would condemn all that are
unworthy of everlasting happiness to endless punishment.
But if He suffer them to be punished for a long time, or even
at all, must He not shut up His tender mercies, which the
Psalmist implies He will not do? For he does not say, Shall
He in anger shut up His tender mercies for a long period?
but he implies that He will not shut them up at all.</p>

<p>And they deny that thus God's threat of judgment is proved
to be false even though He condemn no man, any more than
we can say that His threat to overthrow Nineveh was false,
though the destruction which was absolutely predicted was
not accomplished. For He did not say, "Nineveh shall be
overthrown if they do not repent and amend their ways," but
without any such condition He foretold that the city should
be overthrown. And this prediction, they maintain, was true
because God predicted the punishment which they deserved,
although He was not to inflict it. For though He spared
them on their repentance, yet He was certainly aware that
they would repent, and, notwithstanding, absolutely and definitely
predicted that the city should be overthrown. This
was true, they say, in the truth of severity, because they were
worthy of it; but in respect of the compassion which checked
His anger, so that He spared the suppliants from the punishment
with which He had threatened the rebellious, it was not
true. If, then, He spared those whom His own holy prophet
was provoked at His sparing, how much more shall He spare
those more wretched suppliants for whom all His saints shall
intercede? And they suppose that this conjecture of theirs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[Pg 447]</a></span>
is not hinted at in Scripture, for the sake of stimulating many
to reformation of life through fear of very protracted or eternal
sufferings, and of stimulating others to pray for those who
have not reformed. However, they think that the divine
oracles are not altogether silent on this point; for they ask
to what purpose is it said, "How great is Thy goodness which
Thou hast hidden for them that fear Thee,"<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id="FNanchor_890_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890_890" class="fnanchor">[890]</a> if it be not to
teach us that the great and hidden sweetness of God's mercy
is concealed in order that men may fear? To the same purpose
they think the apostle said, "For God hath concluded
all men in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all,"<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id="FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class="fnanchor">[891]</a>
signifying that no one should be condemned by God. And
yet they who hold this opinion do not extend it to the acquittal
or liberation of the devil and his angels. Their human
tenderness is moved only towards men, and they plead chiefly
their own cause, holding out false hopes of impunity to their
own depraved lives by means of this quasi compassion of God
to the whole race. Consequently they who promise this impunity
even to the prince of the devils and his satellites make
a still fuller exhibition of the mercy of God.</p>


<p class="center">19. <i>Of those who promise impunity from all sins even to heretics, through
virtue of their participation of the body of Christ.</i></p>

<p>So, too, there are others who promise this deliverance from
eternal punishment, not, indeed, to all men, but only to those
who have been washed in Christian baptism, and who become
partakers of the body of Christ, no matter how they have
lived, or what heresy or impiety they have fallen into. They
ground this opinion on the saying of Jesus, "This is the bread
which cometh down from heaven, that if any man eat thereof,
he shall not die. I am the living bread which came down
from heaven. If a man eat of this bread, he shall live for
ever."<a name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">[892]</a> Therefore, say they, it follows that these persons
must be delivered from death eternal, and at one time or other
be introduced to everlasting life.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>20. <i>Of those who promise this indulgence not to all, but only to those who have
been baptized as catholics, though afterwards they have broken out into
many crimes and heresies.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There are others still who make this promise not even to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[Pg 448]</a></span>
all who have received the sacraments of the baptism of Christ
and of His body, but only to the catholics, however badly
they have lived. For these have eaten the body of Christ,
not only sacramentally but really, being incorporated in His
body, as the apostle says, "We, being many, are one bread,
one body;"<a name="FNanchor_893_893" id="FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class="fnanchor">[893]</a> so that, though they have afterwards lapsed into
some heresy, or even into heathenism and idolatry, yet by
virtue of this one thing, that they have received the baptism
of Christ, and eaten the body of Christ, in the body of Christ,
that is to say, in the catholic Church, they shall not die
eternally, but at one time or other obtain eternal life; and all
that wickedness of theirs shall not avail to make their punishment
eternal, but only proportionately long and severe.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>21. <i>Of those who assert that all catholics who continue in the faith, even though
by the depravity of their lives they have merited hell fire, shall be saved on
account of the "foundation" of their faith.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>There are some, too, who found upon the expression of
Scripture, "He that endureth to the end shall be saved,"<a name="FNanchor_894_894" id="FNanchor_894_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894_894" class="fnanchor">[894]</a> and
who promise salvation only to those who continue in the
Church catholic; and though such persons have lived badly,
yet, say they, they shall be saved as by fire through virtue of
the foundation of which the apostle says, "For other foundation
hath no man laid than that which is laid, which is Christ
Jesus. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold,
silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble; every man's work
shall be made manifest: for the day of the Lord shall declare
it, for it shall be revealed by fire; and each man's work
shall be proved of what sort it is. If any man's work shall
endure which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a
reward. But if any man's work shall be burned, he shall
suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as through
fire."<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">[895]</a> They say, accordingly, that the catholic Christian, no
matter what his life be, has Christ as his foundation, while
this foundation is not possessed by any heresy which is separated
from the unity of His body. And therefore, through
virtue of this foundation, even though the catholic Christian
by the inconsistency of his life has been as one building up
wood, hay, stubble, upon it, they believe that he shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[Pg 449]</a></span>
saved by fire, in other words, that he shall be delivered after
tasting the pain of that fire to which the wicked shall be condemned
at the last judgment.</p>


<p class="center">22. <i>Of those who fancy that the sins which are intermingled with alms-deeds
shall not be charged at the day of judgment.</i></p>

<p>I have also met with some who are of opinion that such
only as neglect to cover their sins with alms-deeds shall be
punished in everlasting fire; and they cite the words of the
Apostle James, "He shall have judgment without mercy who
hath shown no mercy."<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id="FNanchor_896_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896_896" class="fnanchor">[896]</a> Therefore, say they, he who has
not amended his ways, but yet has intermingled his profligate
and wicked actions with works of mercy, shall receive mercy
in the judgment, so that he shall either quite escape condemnation,
or shall be liberated from his doom after some time
shorter or longer. They suppose that this was the reason
why the Judge Himself of quick and dead declined to mention
anything else than works of mercy done or omitted, when
awarding to those on His right hand life eternal, and to those
on His left everlasting punishment.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id="FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class="fnanchor">[897]</a> To the same purpose,
they say, is the daily petition we make in the Lord's prayer,
"Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors."<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id="FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class="fnanchor">[898]</a> For, no
doubt, whoever pardons the person who has wronged him does
a charitable action. And this has been so highly commended
by the Lord Himself, that He says, "For if ye forgive men
their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:
but if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
Father forgive your trespasses."<a name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">[899]</a> And so it is to this kind
of alms-deeds that the saying of the Apostle James refers,
"He shall have judgment without mercy that hath shown no
mercy." And our Lord, they say, made no distinction of
great and small sins, but "Your Father will forgive your sins,
if ye forgive men theirs." Consequently they conclude that,
though a man has led an abandoned life up to the last day of
it, yet whatsoever his sins have been, they are all remitted by
virtue of this daily prayer, if only he has been mindful to
attend to this one thing, that when they who have done him
any injury ask his pardon, he forgive them from his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[Pg 450]</a></span></p>

<p>When, by God's help, I have replied to all these errors, I
shall conclude this (twenty-first) book.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Against those who are of opinion that the punishment neither of the devil nor
of wicked men shall be eternal.</i></p>

<p>First of all, it behoves us to inquire and to recognise why
the Church has not been able to tolerate the idea that promises
cleansing or indulgence to the devil even after the most severe
and protracted punishment. For so many holy men, imbued
with the spirit of the Old and New Testament, did not grudge
to angels of any rank or character that they should enjoy the
blessedness of the heavenly kingdom after being cleansed by
suffering, but rather they perceived that they could not invalidate
nor evacuate the divine sentence which the Lord
predicted that He would pronounce in the judgment, saying,
"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared
for the devil and his angels."<a name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">[900]</a> For here it is evident that
the devil and his angels shall burn in everlasting fire. And
there is also that declaration in the Apocalypse, "The devil
their deceiver was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone,
where also are the beast and the false prophet. And they
shall be tormented day and night for ever."<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id="FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class="fnanchor">[901]</a> In the former
passage "everlasting" is used, in the latter "for ever;" and
by these words Scripture is wont to mean nothing else than
endless duration. And therefore no other reason, no reason
more obvious and just, can be found for holding it as the fixed
and immovable belief of the truest piety, that the devil and
his angels shall never return to the justice and life of the
saints, than that Scripture, which deceives no man, says that
God spared them not, and that they were condemned beforehand
by Him, and cast into prisons of darkness in hell,<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id="FNanchor_902_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902_902" class="fnanchor">[902]</a> being
reserved to the judgment of the last day, when eternal fire
shall receive them, in which they shall be tormented world
without end. And if this be so, how can it be believed that
all men, or even some, shall be withdrawn from the endurance
of punishment after some time has been spent in it? how can
this be believed without enervating our faith in the eternal
punishment of the devils? For if all or some of those to
whom it shall be said, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[Pg 451]</a></span>
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,"<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id="FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class="fnanchor">[903]</a> are not to
be always in that fire, then what reason is there for believing
that the devil and his angels shall always be there? Or is
perhaps the sentence of God, which is to be pronounced on
wicked men and angels alike, to be true in the case of the
angels, false in that of men? Plainly it will be so if the
conjectures of men are to weigh more than the word of God.
But because this is absurd, they who desire to be rid of eternal
punishment ought to abstain from arguing against God, and
rather, while yet there is opportunity, obey the divine commands.
Then what a fond fancy is it to suppose that eternal
punishment means long-continued punishment, while eternal
life means life without end, since Christ in the very same
passage spoke of both in similar terms in one and the same
sentence, "These shall go away into eternal punishment, but
the righteous into life eternal!"<a name="FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">[904]</a> If both destinies are
"eternal," then we must either understand both as long-continued
but at last terminating, or both as endless. For they
are correlative,&mdash;on the one hand, punishment eternal, on the
other hand, life eternal. And to say in one and the same
sense, life eternal shall be endless, punishment eternal shall
come to an end, is the height of absurdity. Wherefore, as
the eternal life of the saints shall be endless, so too the eternal
punishment of those who are doomed to it shall have no end.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Against those who fancy that in the judgment of God all the accused will be
spared in virtue of the prayers of the saints.</i></p>

<p>And this reasoning is equally conclusive against those who,
in their own interest, but under the guise of a greater tenderness
of spirit, attempt to invalidate the words of God, and
who assert that these words are true, not because men shall
suffer those things which are threatened by God, but because
they deserve to suffer them. For God, they say, will yield
them to the prayers of His saints, who will then the more
earnestly pray for their enemies, as they shall be more perfect
in holiness, and whose prayers will be the more efficacious
and the more worthy of God's ear, because now purged from
all sin whatsoever. Why, then, if in that perfected holiness
their prayers be so pure and all-availing, will they not use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[Pg 452]</a></span>
them in behalf of the angels for whom eternal fire is prepared,
that God may mitigate His sentence and alter it, and extricate
them from that fire? Or will there, perhaps, be some one hardy
enough to affirm that even the holy angels will make common
cause with holy men (then become the equals of God's angels),
and will intercede for the guilty, both men and angels, that
mercy may spare them the punishment which truth has pronounced
them to deserve? But this has been asserted by no
one sound in the faith, nor will be. Otherwise there is no
reason why the Church should not even now pray for the
devil and his angels, since God her Master has ordered her
to pray for her enemies. The reason, then, which prevents
the Church from now praying for the wicked angels, whom
she knows to be her enemies, is the identical reason which
shall prevent her, however perfected in holiness, from praying
at the last judgment for those men who are to be punished in
eternal fire. At present she prays for her enemies among
men, because they have yet opportunity for fruitful repentance.
For what does she especially beg for them but that
"God would grant them repentance," as the apostle says,
"that they may return to soberness out of the snare of the
devil, by whom they are held captive according to his will?"<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">[905]</a>
But if the Church were certified who those are, who, though
they are still abiding in this life, are yet predestinated to go
with the devil into eternal fire, then for them she could no
more pray than for him. But since she has this certainty
regarding no man, she prays for all her enemies who yet live
in this world; and yet she is not heard in behalf of all. But
she is heard in the case of those only who, though they oppose
the Church, are yet predestinated to become her sons through
her intercession. But if any retain an impenitent heart until
death, and are not converted from enemies into sons, does the
Church continue to pray for them, for the spirits, <i>i.e.</i>, of such
persons deceased? And why does she cease to pray for them,
unless because the man who was not translated into Christ's
kingdom while he was in the body, is now judged to be of
Satan's following?</p>

<p>It is then, I say, the same reason which prevents the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[Pg 453]</a></span>
Church at any time from praying for the wicked angels, which
prevents her from praying hereafter for those men who are to
be punished in eternal fire; and this also is the reason why,
though she prays even for the wicked so long as they live,
she yet does not even in this world pray for the unbelieving
and godless who are dead. For some of the dead, indeed, the
prayer of the Church or of pious individuals is heard; but it
is for those who, having been regenerated in Christ, did not
spend their life so wickedly that they can be judged unworthy
of such compassion, nor so well that they can be considered
to have no need of it. As also, after the resurrection, there
will be some of the dead to whom, after they have endured
the pains proper to the spirits of the dead, mercy shall be
accorded, and acquittal from the punishment of eternal fire.
For were there not some whose sins, though not remitted in
this life, shall be remitted in that which is to come, it could
not be truly said, "They shall not be forgiven, neither in this
world, neither in that which is to come."<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id="FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class="fnanchor">[906]</a> But when the Judge
of quick and dead has said, "Come, ye blessed of my Father,
inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of
the world," and to those on the other side, "Depart from me,
ye cursed, into the eternal fire, which is prepared for the
devil and his angels," and "These shall go away into eternal
punishment, but the righteous into eternal life,"<a name="FNanchor_907_907" id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class="fnanchor">[907]</a> it were
excessively presumptuous to say that the punishment of any
of those whom God has said shall go away into eternal
punishment shall not be eternal, and so bring either despair
or doubt upon the corresponding promise of life eternal.</p>

<p>Let no man then so understand the words of the Psalmist,
"Shall God forget to be gracious? shall He shut up in His
anger His tender mercies?"<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">[908]</a> as if the sentence of God were
true of good men, false of bad men, or true of good men and
wicked angels, but false of bad men. For the Psalmist's words
refer to the vessels of mercy and the children of the promise,
of whom the prophet himself was one; for when he had said,
"Shall God forget to be gracious? shall He shut up in His
anger His tender mercies?" and then immediately subjoins,
"And I said, Now I begin: this is the change wrought by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[Pg 454]</a></span>
the right hand of the Most High,"<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">[909]</a> he manifestly explained
what he meant by the words, "Shall He shut up in His
anger His tender mercies?" For God's anger is this mortal
life, in which man is made like to vanity, and his days pass
as a shadow.<a name="FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">[910]</a> Yet in this anger God does not forget to be
gracious, causing His sun to shine and His rain to descend on
the just and the unjust;<a name="FNanchor_911_911" id="FNanchor_911_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911_911" class="fnanchor">[911]</a> and thus He does not in His anger
cut short His tender mercies, and especially in what the
Psalmist speaks of in the words, "Now I begin: this change
is from the right hand of the Most High;" for He changes for
the better the vessels of mercy, even while they are still in
this most wretched life, which is God's anger, and even while
His anger is manifesting itself in this miserable corruption;
for "in His anger He does not shut up His tender mercies."
And since the truth of this divine canticle is quite satisfied by
this application of it, there is no need to give it a reference to
that place in which those who do not belong to the city of God
are punished in eternal fire. But if any persist in extending
its application to the torments of the wicked, let them at least
understand it so that the anger of God, which has threatened
the wicked with eternal punishment, shall abide, but shall be
mixed with mercy to the extent of alleviating the torments
which might justly be inflicted; so that the wicked shall
neither wholly escape, nor only for a time endure these threatened
pains, but that they shall be less severe and more endurable
than they deserve. Thus the anger of God shall continue,
and at the same time He will not in this anger shut up His
tender mercies. But even this hypothesis I am not to be
supposed to affirm because I do not positively oppose it.<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id="FNanchor_912_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912_912" class="fnanchor">[912]</a></p>

<p>As for those who find an empty threat rather than a truth
in such passages as these: "Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire;" and "These shall go away into eternal
punishment;"<a name="FNanchor_913_913" id="FNanchor_913_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913_913" class="fnanchor">[913]</a> and "They shall be tormented for ever and
ever;"<a name="FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">[914]</a> and "Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall
not be quenched,"<a name="FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">[915]</a>&mdash;such persons, I say, are most emphatically
and abundantly refuted, not by me so much as by the divine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">[Pg 455]</a></span>
Scripture itself. For the men of Nineveh repented in this
life, and therefore their repentance was fruitful, inasmuch as
they sowed in that field which the Lord meant to be sown in
tears that it might afterwards be reaped in joy. And yet who
will deny that God's prediction was fulfilled in their case, if
at least he observes that God destroys sinners not only in
anger but also in compassion? For sinners are destroyed in
two ways,&mdash;either, like the Sodomites, the men themselves are
punished for their sins, or, like the Ninevites, the men's sins
are destroyed by repentance. God's prediction, therefore, was
fulfilled,&mdash;the wicked Nineveh was overthrown, and a good
Nineveh built up. For its walls and houses remained standing;
the city was overthrown in its depraved manners. And
thus, though the prophet was provoked that the destruction
which the inhabitants dreaded, because of his prediction, did
not take place, yet that which God's foreknowledge had predicted
did take place, for He who foretold the destruction
knew how it should be fulfilled in a less calamitous sense.</p>

<p>But that these perversely compassionate persons may see
what is the purport of these words, "How great is the abundance
of Thy sweetness, Lord, which Thou hast hidden for them
that fear Thee,"<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id="FNanchor_916_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916_916" class="fnanchor">[916]</a> let them read what follows: "And Thou hast
perfected it for them that hope in Thee." For what means,
"Thou hast hidden it for them that fear Thee," "Thou hast
perfected it for them that hope in Thee," unless this, that to
those who through fear of punishment seek to establish their
own righteousness by the law, the righteousness of God is not
sweet, because they are ignorant of it? They have not tasted
it. For they hope in themselves, not in Him; and therefore
God's abundant sweetness is hidden from them. They fear
God, indeed, but it is with that servile fear "which is not in
love; for perfect love casteth out fear."<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id="FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class="fnanchor">[917]</a> Therefore to them
that hope in Him He perfecteth His sweetness, inspiring them
with His own love, so that with a holy fear, which love does
not cast out, but which endureth for ever, they may, when
they glory, glory in the Lord. For the righteousness of God
is Christ, "who is of God made unto us," as the apostle says,
"wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">[Pg 456]</a></span>
as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the
Lord."<a name="FNanchor_918_918" id="FNanchor_918_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">[918]</a> This righteousness of God, which is the gift of grace
without merits, is not known by those who go about to establish
their own righteousness, and are therefore not subject to
the righteousness of God, which is Christ.<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id="FNanchor_919_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919_919" class="fnanchor">[919]</a> But it is in this
righteousness that we find the great abundance of God's sweetness,
of which the psalm says, "Taste and see how sweet the
Lord is."<a name="FNanchor_920_920" id="FNanchor_920_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920_920" class="fnanchor">[920]</a> And this we rather taste than partake of to satiety
in this our pilgrimage. We hunger and thirst for it now, that
hereafter we may be satisfied with it when we see Him as He
is, and that is fulfilled which is written, "I shall be satisfied
when Thy glory shall be manifested."<a name="FNanchor_921_921" id="FNanchor_921_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921_921" class="fnanchor">[921]</a> It is thus that Christ
perfects the great abundance of His sweetness to them that
hope in Him. But if God conceals His sweetness from them
that fear Him in the sense that these our objectors fancy, so that
men's ignorance of His purpose of mercy towards the wicked
may lead them to fear Him and live better, and so that there
may be prayer made for those who are not living as they
ought, how then does He perfect His sweetness to them that
hope in Him, since, if their dreams be true, it is this very
sweetness which will prevent Him from punishing those who
do not hope in Him? Let us then seek that sweetness of His,
which He perfects to them that hope in Him, not that which
He is supposed to perfect to those who despise and blaspheme
Him; for in vain, after this life, does a man seek for what he
has neglected to provide while in this life.</p>

<p>Then, as to that saying of the apostle, "For God hath concluded
all in unbelief, that He may have mercy upon all,"<a name="FNanchor_922_922" id="FNanchor_922_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922_922" class="fnanchor">[922]</a>
it does not mean that He will condemn no one; but the foregoing
context shows what is meant. The apostle composed
the epistle for the Gentiles who were already believers; and
when he was speaking to them of the Jews who were yet to
believe, he says, "For as ye in times past believed not God,
yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief; even
so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy
they also may obtain mercy." Then he added the words in
question with which these persons beguile themselves: "For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">[Pg 457]</a></span>
God concluded all in unbelief, that He might have mercy
upon all." All whom, if not all those of whom he was speaking,
just as if he had said, "Both you and them?" God then
concluded all those in unbelief, both Jews and Gentiles, whom
He foreknew and predestinated to be conformed to the image
of His Son, in order that they might be confounded by the
bitterness of unbelief, and might repent and believingly turn
to the sweetness of God's mercy, and might take up that
exclamation of the psalm, "How great is the abundance of
Thy sweetness, O Lord, which Thou hast hidden for them that
fear Thee, but hast perfected to them that hope," not in themselves,
but "in Thee." He has mercy, then, on all the vessels
of mercy. And what means "all?" Both those of the
Gentiles and those of the Jews whom He predestinated, called,
justified, glorified: none of these will be condemned by Him;
but we cannot say none of all men whatever.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>25. <i>Whether those who received heretical baptism, and have afterwards fallen
away to wickedness of life; or those who have received catholic baptism,
but have afterwards passed over to heresy and schism; or those who have
remained in the catholic Church in which they were baptized, but have
continued to live immorally,&mdash;may hope through the virtue of the sacraments
for the remission of eternal punishment.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But let us now reply to those who promise deliverance
from eternal fire, not to the devil and his angels (as neither
do they of whom we have been speaking), nor even to all
men whatever, but only to those who have been washed by
the baptism of Christ, and have become partakers of His body
and blood, no matter how they have lived, no matter what
heresy or impiety they have fallen into. But they are contradicted
by the apostle, where he says, "Now the works of
the flesh are manifest, which are these; fornication, uncleanness,
lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variances,
emulations, wrath, strife, heresies, envyings, drunkenness,
revellings, and the like: of the which I tell you before, as I
have also told you in time past, for they which do such
things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."<a name="FNanchor_923_923" id="FNanchor_923_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923_923" class="fnanchor">[923]</a> Certainly
this sentence of the apostle is false, if such persons shall be
delivered after any lapse of time, and shall then inherit the
kingdom of God. But as it is not false, they shall certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[Pg 458]</a></span>
never inherit the kingdom of God. And if they shall never
enter that kingdom, then they shall always be retained in
eternal punishment; for there is no middle place where he
may live unpunished who has not been admitted into that
kingdom.</p>

<p>And therefore we may reasonably inquire how we are to
understand these words of the Lord Jesus: "This is the bread
which cometh down from heaven, that a man may eat thereof,
and not die. I am the living bread which came down from
heaven. If any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever."<a name="FNanchor_924_924" id="FNanchor_924_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924_924" class="fnanchor">[924]</a>
And those, indeed, whom we are now answering, are refuted
in their interpretation of this passage by those whom we are
shortly to answer, and who do not promise this deliverance to
all who have received the sacraments of baptism and the
Lord's body, but only to the catholics, however wickedly they
live; for these, say they, have eaten the Lord's body not only
sacramentally, but really, being constituted members of His
body, of which the apostle says, "We being many are one
bread, one body."<a name="FNanchor_925_925" id="FNanchor_925_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925_925" class="fnanchor">[925]</a> He then who is in the unity of Christ's
body (that is to say, in the Christian membership), of which
body the faithful have been wont to receive the sacrament at
the altar, that man is truly said to eat the body and drink
the blood of Christ. And consequently heretics and schismatics
being separate from the unity of this body, are able
to receive the same sacrament, but with no profit to themselves,&mdash;nay,
rather to their own hurt, so that they are rather
more severely judged than liberated after some time. For
they are not in that bond of peace which is symbolized by
that sacrament.</p>

<p>But again, even those who sufficiently understand that he
who is not in the body of Christ cannot be said to eat the
body of Christ, are in error when they promise liberation
from the fire of eternal punishment to persons who fall away
from the unity of that body into heresy, or even into heathenish
superstition. For, in the first place, they ought to consider
how intolerable it is, and how discordant with sound
doctrine, to suppose that many, indeed, or almost all, who
have forsaken the Church catholic, and have originated impious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[Pg 459]</a></span>
heresies and become heresiarchs, should enjoy a destiny
superior to those who never were catholics, but have fallen
into the snares of these others; that is to say, if the fact of
their catholic baptism and original reception of the sacrament
of the body of Christ in the true body of Christ is sufficient
to deliver these heresiarchs from eternal punishment. For
certainly he who deserts the faith, and from a deserter becomes
an assailant, is worse than he who has not deserted the
faith he never held. And, in the second place, they are contradicted
by the apostle, who, after enumerating the works
of the flesh, says with reference to heresies, "They who do
such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God."</p>

<p>And therefore neither ought such persons as lead an
abandoned and damnable life to be confident of salvation,
though they persevere to the end in the communion of the
Church catholic, and comfort themselves with the words, "He
that endureth to the end shall be saved." By the iniquity of
their life they abandon that very righteousness of life which
Christ is to them, whether it be by fornication, or by perpetrating
in their body the other uncleannesses which the apostle would
not so much as mention, or by a dissolute luxury, or by doing
any one of those things of which he says, "They who do such
things shall not inherit the kingdom of God." Consequently,
they who do such things shall not exist anywhere but in
eternal punishment, since they cannot be in the kingdom of
God. For, while they continue in such things to the very
end of life, they cannot be said to abide in Christ to the end;
for to abide in Him is to abide in the faith of Christ. And
this faith, according to the apostle's definition of it, "worketh
by love."<a name="FNanchor_926_926" id="FNanchor_926_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926_926" class="fnanchor">[926]</a> And "love," as he elsewhere says, "worketh no
evil."<a name="FNanchor_927_927" id="FNanchor_927_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927_927" class="fnanchor">[927]</a> Neither can these persons be said to eat the body of
Christ, for they cannot even be reckoned among His members.
For, not to mention other reasons, they cannot be at once the
members of Christ and the members of a harlot. In fine, He
Himself, when He says, "He that eateth my flesh and drinketh
my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him,"<a name="FNanchor_928_928" id="FNanchor_928_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928_928" class="fnanchor">[928]</a> shows what it is
in reality, and not sacramentally, to eat His body and drink
His blood; for this is to dwell in Christ, that He also may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[Pg 460]</a></span>
dwell in us. So that it is as if He said, He that dwelleth
not in me, and in whom I do not dwell, let him not say or
think that he eateth my body or drinketh my blood. Accordingly,
they who are not Christ's members do not dwell in
Him. And they who make themselves members of a harlot,
are not members of Christ unless they have penitently abandoned
that evil, and have returned to this good to be reconciled
to it.</p>


<p class="center">26. <i>What it is to have Christ for a foundation, and who they are to whom
salvation as by fire is promised.</i></p>

<p>But, say they, the catholic Christians have Christ for a
foundation, and they have not fallen away from union with
Him, no matter how depraved a life they have built on this
foundation, as wood, hay, stubble; and accordingly the well-directed
faith by which Christ is their foundation will suffice
to deliver them some time from the continuance of that fire,
though it be with loss, since those things they have built on
it shall be burned. Let the Apostle James summarily reply
to them: "If any man say he has faith, and have not works,
can faith save him?"<a name="FNanchor_929_929" id="FNanchor_929_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929_929" class="fnanchor">[929]</a> And who then is it, they ask, of
whom the Apostle Paul says, "But he himself shall be saved,
yet so as by fire?"<a name="FNanchor_930_930" id="FNanchor_930_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930_930" class="fnanchor">[930]</a> Let us join them in their inquiry; and
one thing is very certain, that it is not he of whom James
speaks, else we should make the two apostles contradict one
another, if the one says, "Though a man's works be evil, his
faith will save him as by fire," while the other says, "If he
have not good works, can his faith save him?"</p>

<p>We shall then ascertain who it is who can be saved by
fire, if we first discover what it is to have Christ for a foundation.
And this we may very readily learn from the image
itself. In a building the foundation is first. Whoever, then,
has Christ in his heart, so that no earthly or temporal things&mdash;not
even those that are legitimate and allowed&mdash;are preferred
to Him, has Christ as a foundation. But if these
things be preferred, then even though a man seem to have faith
in Christ, yet Christ is not the foundation to that man; and
much more if he, in contempt of wholesome precepts, seek
forbidden gratifications, is he clearly convicted of putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[Pg 461]</a></span>
Christ not first but last, since he has despised Him as his
ruler, and has preferred to fulfil his own wicked lusts, in contempt
of Christ's commands and allowances. Accordingly, if
any Christian man loves a harlot, and, attaching himself to
her, becomes one body, he has not now Christ for a foundation.
But if any one loves his own wife, and loves her as Christ would
have him love her, who can doubt that he has Christ for a
foundation? But if he loves her in the world's fashion, carnally,
as the disease of lust prompts him, and as the Gentiles
love who know not God, even this the apostle, or rather
Christ by the apostle, allows as a venial fault. And therefore
even such a man may have Christ for a foundation. For
so long as he does not prefer such an affection or pleasure to
Christ, Christ is his foundation, though on it he builds wood,
hay, stubble; and therefore he shall be saved as by fire. For
the fire of affliction shall burn such luxurious pleasures and
earthly loves, though they be not damnable, because enjoyed
in lawful wedlock. And of this fire the fuel is bereavement,
and all those calamities which consume these joys. Consequently
the superstructure will be loss to him who has built
it, for he shall not retain it, but shall be agonized by the loss
of those things in the enjoyment of which he found pleasure.
But by this fire he shall be saved through virtue of the foundation,
because even if a persecutor demanded whether he
would retain Christ or these things, he would prefer Christ.
Would you hear, in the apostle's own words, who he is who
builds on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones? "He
that is unmarried," he says, "careth for the things that
belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_931_931" id="FNanchor_931_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931_931" class="fnanchor">[931]</a> Would
you hear who he is that buildeth wood, hay, stubble? "But
he that is married careth for the things that are of the world,
how he may please his wife."<a name="FNanchor_932_932" id="FNanchor_932_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932_932" class="fnanchor">[932]</a> "Every man's work shall be
made manifest: for the day shall declare it,"&mdash;the day, no
doubt, of tribulation&mdash;"because," says he, "it shall be revealed
by fire."<a name="FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">[933]</a> He calls tribulation fire, just as it is elsewhere
said, "The furnace proves the vessels of the potter, and
the trial of affliction righteous men."<a name="FNanchor_934_934" id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class="fnanchor">[934]</a> And "The fire shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[Pg 462]</a></span>
try every man's work of what sort it is. If any man's work
abide"&mdash;for a man's care for the things of the Lord, how he
may please the Lord, abides&mdash;"which he hath built thereupon,
he shall receive a reward,"&mdash;that is, he shall reap the
fruit of his care. "But if any man's work shall be burned,
he shall suffer loss,"&mdash;for what he loved he shall not retain:&mdash;"but
he himself shall be saved,"&mdash;for no tribulation shall
have moved him from that stable foundation,&mdash;"yet so as by
fire;"<a name="FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">[935]</a> for that which he possessed with the sweetness of
love he does not lose without the sharp sting of pain. Here,
then, as seems to me, we have a fire which destroys neither,
but enriches the one, brings loss to the other, proves both.</p>

<p>But if this passage [of Corinthians] is to interpret that
fire of which the Lord shall say to those on His left hand,
"Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire,"<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">[936]</a> so that
among these we are to believe there are those who build on
the foundation wood, hay, stubble, and that they, through
virtue of the good foundation, shall after a time be liberated
from the fire that is the award of their evil deserts, what
then shall we think of those on the right hand, to whom it
shall be said, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit the
kingdom prepared for you,"<a name="FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">[937]</a> unless that they are those who
have built on the foundation gold, silver, precious stones?
But if the fire of which our Lord speaks is the same as that
of which the apostle says, "Yet so as by fire," then both&mdash;that
is to say, both those on the right as well as those on the
left&mdash;are to be cast into it. For that fire is to try both,
since it is said, "For the day of the Lord shall declare it, because
it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every
man's work of what sort it is."<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">[938]</a> If, therefore, the fire shall
try both, in order that if any man's work abide&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> if the
superstructure be not consumed by the fire&mdash;he may receive
a reward, and that if his work is burned he may suffer loss,
certainly that fire is not the eternal fire itself. For into
this latter fire only those on the left hand shall be cast, and
that with final and everlasting doom; but that former fire
proves those on the right hand. But some of them it so
proves that it does not burn and consume the structure which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[Pg 463]</a></span>
is found to have been built by them on Christ as the foundation;
while others of them it proves in another fashion, so as
to burn what they have built up, and thus cause them to
suffer loss, while they themselves are saved because they have
retained Christ, who was laid as their sure foundation, and
have loved Him above all. But if they are saved, then certainly
they shall stand at the right hand, and shall with the
rest hear the sentence, "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you;" and not at the left
hand, where those shall be who shall not be saved, and shall
therefore hear the doom, "Depart from me, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire." For from that fire no man shall be saved,
because they all shall go away into eternal punishment, where
their worms shall not die, nor their fire be quenched, in which
they shall be tormented day and night for ever.</p>

<p>But if it be said that in the interval of time between the
death of this body and that last day of judgment and retribution
which shall follow the resurrection, the bodies of the
dead shall be exposed to a fire of such a nature that it shall
not affect those who have not in this life indulged in such
pleasures and pursuits as shall be consumed like wood, hay,
stubble, but shall affect those others who have carried with
them structures of that kind; if it be said that such worldliness,
being venial, shall be consumed in the fire of tribulation
either here only, or here and hereafter both, or here that it may
not be hereafter,&mdash;this I do not contradict, because possibly
it is true. For perhaps even the death of the body is itself
a part of this tribulation, for it results from the first transgression,
so that the time which follows death takes its colour
in each case from the nature of the man's building. The
persecutions, too, which have crowned the martyrs, and which
Christians of all kinds suffer, try both buildings like a fire,
consuming some, along with the builders themselves, if Christ
is not found in them as their foundation, while others they
consume without the builders, because Christ is found in
them, and they are saved, though with loss; and other buildings
still they do not consume, because such materials as
abide for ever are found in them. In the end of the world
there shall be in the time of Antichrist tribulation such as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[Pg 464]</a></span>
has never before been. How many edifices there shall then be,
of gold or of hay, built on the best foundation, Christ Jesus,
which that fire shall prove, bringing joy to some, loss to
others, but without destroying either sort, because of this
stable foundation! But whosoever prefers, I do not say his
wife, with whom he lives for carnal pleasure, but any of those
relatives who afford no delight of such a kind, and whom it
is right to love,&mdash;whosoever prefers these to Christ, and loves
them after a human and carnal fashion, has not Christ as a
foundation, and will therefore not be saved by fire, nor indeed
at all; for he shall not possibly dwell with the Saviour, who
says very explicitly concerning this very matter, "He that loveth
father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and he
that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of
me."<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id="FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class="fnanchor">[939]</a> But he who loves his relations carnally, and yet so that
he does not prefer them to Christ, but would rather want them
than Christ if he were put to the proof, shall be saved by fire,
because it is necessary that by the loss of these relations he
suffer pain in proportion to his love. And he who loves
father, mother, sons, daughters, according to Christ, so that
he aids them in obtaining His kingdom and cleaving to Him,
or loves them because they are members of Christ, God forbid
that this love should be consumed as wood, hay, stubble, and
not rather be reckoned a structure of gold, silver, precious
stones. For how can a man love those more than Christ
whom he loves only for Christ's sake?</p>


<p class="center">27. <i>Against the belief of those who think that the sins which have been accompanied
with almsgiving will do them no harm.</i></p>

<p>It remains to reply to those who maintain that those only
shall burn in eternal fire who neglect alms-deeds proportioned
to their sins, resting this opinion on the words of the
Apostle James, "He shall have judgment without mercy that
hath showed no mercy."<a name="FNanchor_940_940" id="FNanchor_940_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940_940" class="fnanchor">[940]</a> Therefore, they say, he that hath
showed mercy, though he has not reformed his dissolute conduct,
but has lived wickedly and iniquitously even while
abounding in alms, shall have a merciful judgment, so that he
shall either be not condemned at all, or shall be delivered
from final judgment after a time. And for the same reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[Pg 465]</a></span>
they suppose that Christ will discriminate between those on
the right hand and those on the left, and will send the one
party into His kingdom, the other into eternal punishment, on
the sole ground of their attention to or neglect of works of
charity. Moreover, they endeavour to use the prayer which
the Lord Himself taught as a proof and bulwark of their
opinion, that daily sins which are never abandoned can be
expiated through alms-deeds, no matter how offensive or of
what sort they be. For, say they, as there is no day on
which Christians ought not to use this prayer, so there is no
sin of any kind which, though committed every day, is not
remitted when we say, "Forgive us our debts," if we take
care to fulfil what follows, "as we forgive our debtors."<a name="FNanchor_941_941" id="FNanchor_941_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">[941]</a> For,
they go on to say, the Lord does not say, "If ye forgive men
their trespasses, your heavenly Father will forgive you your
little daily sins," but "will forgive you your sins." Therefore,
be they of any kind or magnitude whatever, be they perpetrated
daily and never abandoned or subdued in this life,
they can be pardoned, they presume, through alms-deeds.</p>

<p>But they are right to inculcate the giving of alms proportioned
to past sins; for if they said that any kind of alms
could obtain the divine pardon of great sins committed daily
and with habitual enormity, if they said that such sins could
thus be daily remitted, they would see that their doctrine
was absurd and ridiculous. For they would thus be driven
to acknowledge that it were possible for a very wealthy man
to buy absolution from murders, adulteries, and all manner of
wickedness, by paying a daily alms of ten paltry coins. And
if it be most absurd and insane to make such an acknowledgment,
and if we still ask what are those fitting alms of
which even the forerunner of Christ said, "Bring forth therefore
fruits meet for repentance,"<a name="FNanchor_942_942" id="FNanchor_942_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942_942" class="fnanchor">[942]</a> undoubtedly it will be found
that they are not such as are done by men who undermine
their life by daily enormities even to the very end. For
they suppose that by giving to the poor a small fraction
of the wealth they acquire by extortion and spoliation they
can propitiate Christ, so that they may with impunity
commit the most damnable sins, in the persuasion that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">[Pg 466]</a></span>
have bought from Him a licence to transgress, or rather
do buy a daily indulgence. And if they for one crime have
distributed all their goods to Christ's needy members, that
could profit them nothing unless they desisted from all similar
actions, and attained charity which worketh no evil. He
therefore who does alms-deeds proportioned to his sins must
first begin with himself. For it is not reasonable that a man
who exercises charity towards his neighbour should not do so
towards himself, since he hears the Lord saying, "Thou shalt
love thy neighbour as thyself,"<a name="FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">[943]</a> and again, "Have compassion
on thy soul, and please God."<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id="FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class="fnanchor">[944]</a> He then who has not compassion
on his own soul that he may please God, how can he
be said to do alms-deeds proportioned to his sins? To the
same purpose is that written, "He who is bad to himself, to
whom can he be good?"<a name="FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">[945]</a> We ought therefore to do alms
that we may be heard when we pray that our past sins may
be forgiven, not that while we continue in them we may
think to provide ourselves with a licence for wickedness by
alms-deeds.</p>

<p>The reason, therefore, of our predicting that He will impute
to those on His right hand the alms-deeds they have
done, and charge those on His left with omitting the same, is
that He may thus show the efficacy of charity for the deletion
of past sins, not for impunity in their perpetual commission.
And such persons, indeed, as decline to abandon their evil
habits of life for a better course cannot be said to do charitable
deeds. For this is the purport of the saying, "Inasmuch
as ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it
not to me."<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id="FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class="fnanchor">[946]</a> He shows them that they do not perform
charitable actions even when they think they are doing so.
For if they gave bread to a hungering Christian because he is
a Christian, assuredly they would not deny to themselves the
bread of righteousness, that is, Christ Himself; for God considers
not the person to whom the gift is made, but the spirit
in which it is made. He therefore who loves Christ in a
Christian extends alms to him in the same spirit in which he
draws near to Christ, not in that spirit which would abandon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">[Pg 467]</a></span>
Christ if it could do so with impunity. For in proportion as
a man loves what Christ disapproves does he himself abandon
Christ. For what does it profit a man that he is baptized, if
he is not justified? Did not He who said, "Except a man
be born of water and of the Spirit, he shall not enter into the
kingdom of God,"<a name="FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">[947]</a> say also, "Except your righteousness shall
exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye shall
not enter into the kingdom of heaven?"<a name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">[948]</a> Why do many
through fear of the first saying run to baptism, while few
through fear of the second seek to be justified? As therefore
it is not to his brother a man says, "Thou fool," if when he
says it he is indignant not at the brotherhood, but at the sin
of the offender,&mdash;for otherwise he were guilty of hell fire,&mdash;so
he who extends charity to a Christian does not extend it
to a Christian if he does not love Christ in him. Now he
does not love Christ who refuses to be justified in Him. Or,
again, if a man has been guilty of this sin of calling his
brother Fool, unjustly reviling him without any desire to
remove his sin, his alms-deeds go a small way towards expiating
this fault, unless he adds to this the remedy of reconciliation
which the same passage enjoins. For it is there said,
"Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there rememberest
that thy brother hath aught against thee; leave
there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first be reconciled
to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift."<a name="FNanchor_949_949" id="FNanchor_949_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">[949]</a> Just
so it is a small matter to do alms-deeds, no matter how great
they be, for any sin, so long as the offender continues in the
practice of sin.</p>

<p>Then as to the daily prayer which the Lord Himself taught,
and which is therefore called the Lord's prayer, it obliterates
indeed the sins of the day, when day by day we say, "Forgive
us our debts," and when we not only say but act out that
which follows, "as we forgive our debtors;"<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id="FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class="fnanchor">[950]</a> but we utter
this petition because sins have been committed, and not that
they may be. For by it our Saviour designed to teach us
that, however righteously we live in this life of infirmity and
darkness, we still commit sins for the remission of which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[Pg 468]</a></span>
ought to pray, while we must pardon those who sin against
us that we ourselves also may be pardoned. The Lord then
did not utter the words, "If ye forgive men their trespasses,
your Father will also forgive you your trespasses,"<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id="FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class="fnanchor">[951]</a> in order
that we might contract from this petition such confidence as
should enable us to sin securely from day to day, either putting
ourselves above the fear of human laws, or craftily deceiving
men concerning our conduct, but in order that we
might thus learn not to suppose that we are without sins,
even though we should be free from crimes; as also God
admonished the priests of the old law to this same effect
regarding their sacrifices, which He commanded them to offer
first for their own sins, and then for the sins of the people.
For even the very words of so great a Master and Lord are to
be intently considered. For He does not say, If ye forgive
men their sins, your Father will also forgive you your sins, no
matter of what sort they be, but He says, your sins; for it
was a daily prayer He was teaching, and it was certainly to
disciples already justified He was speaking. What, then,
does He mean by "your sins," but those sins from which not
even you who are justified and sanctified can be free? While,
then, those who seek occasion from this petition to indulge in
habitual sin maintain that the Lord meant to include great
sins, because He did not say, He will forgive you your small
sins, but "your sins," we, on the other hand, taking into
account the character of the persons He was addressing, cannot
see our way to interpret the expression "your sins" of
anything but small sins, because such persons are no longer
guilty of great sins. Nevertheless not even great sins themselves&mdash;sins
from which we must flee with a total reformation
of life&mdash;are forgiven to those who pray, unless they observe
the appended precept, "as ye also forgive your debtors." For
if the very small sins which attach even to the life of the
righteous be not remitted without that condition, how much
further from obtaining indulgence shall those be who are involved
in many great crimes, if, while they cease from perpetrating
such enormities, they still inexorably refuse to remit
any debt incurred to themselves, since the Lord says, "But if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[Pg 469]</a></span>
ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father
forgive your trespasses?"<a name="FNanchor_952_952" id="FNanchor_952_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952_952" class="fnanchor">[952]</a> For this is the purport of the saying
of the Apostle James also, "He shall have judgment without
mercy that hath showed no mercy."<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">[953]</a> For we should
remember that servant whose debt of ten thousand talents his
lord cancelled, but afterwards ordered him to pay up, because
the servant himself had no pity for his fellow-servant who
owed him an hundred pence.<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id="FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class="fnanchor">[954]</a> The words which the Apostle
James subjoins, "And mercy rejoiceth against judgment,"<a name="FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">[955]</a>
find their application among those who are the children of the
promise and vessels of mercy. For even those righteous men,
who have lived with such holiness that they receive into
the eternal habitations others also who have won their friendship
with the mammon of unrighteousness,<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id="FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class="fnanchor">[956]</a> became such only
through the merciful deliverance of Him who justifies the
ungodly, imputing to him a reward according to grace, not
according to debt. For among this number is the apostle,
who says, "I obtained mercy to be faithful."<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">[957]</a></p>

<p>But it must be admitted, that those who are thus received
into the eternal habitations are not of such a character that
their own life would suffice to rescue them without the aid of
the saints, and consequently in their case especially does mercy
rejoice against judgment. And yet we are not on this account
to suppose that every abandoned profligate, who has made
no amendment of his life, is to be received into the eternal
habitations if only he has assisted the saints with the mammon
of unrighteousness,&mdash;that is to say, with money or wealth
which has been unjustly acquired, or, if rightfully acquired, is
yet not the true riches, but only what iniquity counts riches,
because it knows not the true riches in which those persons
abound, who even receive others also into eternal habitations.
There is then a certain kind of life, which is neither, on the
one hand, so bad that those who adopt it are not helped
towards the kingdom of heaven by any bountiful almsgiving
by which they may relieve the wants of the saints, and make
friends who could receive them into eternal habitations, nor,
on the other hand, so good that it of itself suffices to win for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[Pg 470]</a></span>
them that great blessedness, if they do not obtain mercy
through the merits of those whom they have made their friends.
And I frequently wonder that even Virgil should give expression
to this sentence of the Lord, in which He says, "Make
to yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness, that
they may receive you into everlasting habitations;"<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958_958" class="fnanchor">[958]</a> and this
very similar saying, "He that receiveth a prophet, in the
name of a prophet, shall receive a prophet's reward; and he
that receiveth a righteous man, in the name of a righteous
man, shall receive a righteous man's reward."<a name="FNanchor_959_959" id="FNanchor_959_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959_959" class="fnanchor">[959]</a> For when that
poet described the Elysian fields, in which they suppose that
the souls of the blessed dwell, he placed there not only those
who had been able by their own merit to reach that abode,
but added,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And they who grateful memory won<br /></span>
<span class="i1">By services to others done;"<a name="FNanchor_960_960" id="FNanchor_960_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960_960" class="fnanchor">[960]</a><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>that is, they who had served others, and thereby merited to
be remembered by them. Just as if they used the expression
so common in Christian lips, where some humble person commends
himself to one of the saints, and says, Remember me,
and secures that he do so by deserving well at his hand. But
what that kind of life we have been speaking of is, and what
those sins are which prevent a man from winning the kingdom
of God by himself, but yet permit him to avail himself
of the merits of the saints, it is very difficult to ascertain,
very perilous to define. For my own part, in spite of all
investigation, I have been up to the present hour unable to
discover this. And possibly it is hidden from us, lest we
should become careless in avoiding such sins, and so cease to
make progress. For if it were known what these sins are,
which, though they continue, and be not abandoned for a
higher life, do yet not prevent us from seeking and hoping
for the intercession of the saints, human sloth would presumptuously
wrap itself in these sins, and would take no steps to
be disentangled from such wrappings by the deft energy of
any virtue, but would only desire to be rescued by the merits
of other people, whose friendship had been won by a bountiful
use of the mammon of unrighteousness. But now that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[Pg 471]</a></span>
are left in ignorance of the precise nature of that iniquity
which is venial, even though it be persevered in, certainly we
are both more vigilant in our prayers and efforts for progress,
and more careful to secure with the mammon of unrighteousness
friends for ourselves among the saints.</p>

<p>But this deliverance, which is effected by one's own prayers,
or the intercession of holy men, secures that a man be not cast
into eternal fire, but not that, when once he has been cast into
it, he should after a time be rescued from it. For even those
who fancy that what is said of the good ground bringing forth
abundant fruit, some thirty, some sixty, some an hundred fold,
is to be referred to the saints, so that in proportion to their
merits some of them shall deliver thirty men, some sixty,
some an hundred,&mdash;even those who maintain this are yet
commonly inclined to suppose that this deliverance will take
place at, and not after the day of judgment. Under this impression,
some one who observed the unseemly folly with which
men promise themselves impunity on the ground that all will
be included in this method of deliverance, is reported to have
very happily remarked, that we should rather endeavour to live
so well that we shall be all found among the number of those
who are to intercede for the liberation of others, lest these
should be so few in number, that, after they have delivered,
one thirty, another sixty, another a hundred, there should still
remain many who could not be delivered from punishment by
their intercessions, and among them every one who has vainly
and rashly promised himself the fruit of another's labour. But
enough has been said in reply to those who acknowledge the
authority of the same sacred Scriptures as ourselves, but who,
by a mistaken interpretation of them, conceive of the future
rather as they themselves wish, than as the Scriptures teach.
And having given this reply, I now, according to promise,
close this book.</p>

<p class="center">1. <i>Of the creation of angels and men.</i></p>

<p>As we promised in the immediately preceding book, this,
the last of the whole work, shall contain a discussion
of the eternal blessedness of the city of God. This blessedness
is named eternal, not because it shall endure for many
ages, though at last it shall come to an end, but because,
according to the words of the gospel, "of His kingdom there
shall be no end."<a name="FNanchor_961_961" id="FNanchor_961_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961_961" class="fnanchor">[961]</a> Neither shall it enjoy the mere appearance
of perpetuity which is maintained by the rise of fresh
generations to occupy the place of those that have died out, as
in an evergreen the same freshness seems to continue permanently,
and the same appearance of dense foliage is preserved
by the growth of fresh leaves in the room of those that have
withered and fallen; but in that city all the citizens shall be
immortal, men now for the first time enjoying what the holy
angels have never lost. And this shall be accomplished by
God, the most almighty Founder of the city. For He has
promised it, and cannot lie, and has already performed many
of His promises, and has done many unpromised kindnesses
to those whom He now asks to believe that He will do this
also.</p>

<p>For it is He who in the beginning created the world full
of all visible and intelligible beings, among which He created
nothing better than those spirits whom He endowed with intelligence,
and made capable of contemplating and enjoying Him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[Pg 473]</a></span>
and united in our society, which we call the holy and heavenly
city, and in which the material of their sustenance and blessedness
is God Himself, as it were their common food and nourishment.
It is He who gave to this intellectual nature free-will
of such a kind, that if he wished to forsake God his blessedness,
misery should forthwith result. It is He who, when
He foreknew that certain angels would in their pride desire
to suffice for their own blessedness, and would forsake their
great good, did not deprive them of this power, deeming it to
be more befitting His power and goodness to bring good out
of evil than to prevent the evil from coming into existence.
And indeed evil had never been, had not the mutable nature&mdash;mutable,
though good, and created by the most high God
and immutable Good, who created all things good&mdash;brought
evil upon itself by sin. And this its sin is itself proof that
its nature was originally good. For had it not been very good,
though not equal to its Creator, the desertion of God as its
light could not have been an evil to it. For as blindness is
a vice of the eye, and this very fact indicates that the eye
was created to see the light, and as, consequently, vice itself
proves that the eye is more excellent than the other members,
because it is capable of light (for on no other supposition
would it be a vice of the eye to want light), so the nature
which once enjoyed God teaches, even by its very vice, that
it was created the best of all, since it is now miserable because
it does not enjoy God. It is He who with very just punishment
doomed the angels who voluntarily fell to everlasting
misery, and rewarded those who continued in their attachment
to the supreme good with the assurance of endless stability
as the meed of their fidelity. It is He who made also man
himself upright, with the same freedom of will,&mdash;an earthly
animal, indeed, but fit for heaven if he remained faithful to
his Creator, but destined to the misery appropriate to such a
nature if he forsook Him. It is He who, when He foreknew
that man would in his turn sin by abandoning God and
breaking His law, did not deprive him of the power of free-will,
because He at the same time foresaw what good He
Himself would bring out of the evil, and how from this
mortal race, deservedly and justly condemned, He would by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[Pg 474]</a></span>
His grace collect, as now He does, a people so numerous, that
He thus fills up and repairs the blank made by the fallen
angels, and that thus that beloved and heavenly city is not
defrauded of the full number of its citizens, but perhaps may
even rejoice in a still more overflowing population.</p>


<p class="center">2. <i>Of the eternal and unchangeable will of God.</i></p>

<p>It is true that wicked men do many things contrary to God's
will; but so great is His wisdom and power, that all things
which seem adverse to His purpose do still tend towards those
just and good ends and issues which He Himself has foreknown.
And consequently, when God is said to change His
will, as when, <i>e.g.</i>, He becomes angry with those to whom He
was gentle, it is rather they than He who are changed, and
they find Him changed in so far as their experience of suffering
at His hand is new, as the sun is changed to injured eyes, and
becomes as it were fierce from being mild, and hurtful from
being delightful, though in itself it remains the same as it
was. That also is called the will of God which He does in
the hearts of those who obey His commandments; and of this
the apostle says, "For it is God that worketh in you both
to will."<a name="FNanchor_962_962" id="FNanchor_962_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962_962" class="fnanchor">[962]</a> As God's "righteousness" is used not only of the
righteousness wherewith He Himself is righteous, but also of
that which He produces in the man whom He justifies, so also
that is called His law, which, though given by God, is rather
the law of men. For certainly they were men to whom Jesus
said, "It is written in your law,"<a name="FNanchor_963_963" id="FNanchor_963_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963_963" class="fnanchor">[963]</a> though in another place
we read, "The law of his God is in his heart."<a name="FNanchor_964_964" id="FNanchor_964_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964_964" class="fnanchor">[964]</a> According
to this will which God works in men, He is said also to will
what He Himself does not will, but causes His people to will;
as He is said to know what He has caused those to know who
were ignorant of it. For when the apostle says, "But now,
after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God,"<a name="FNanchor_965_965" id="FNanchor_965_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965_965" class="fnanchor">[965]</a>
we cannot suppose that God there for the first time knew
those who were foreknown by Him before the foundation of
the world; but He is said to have known them then, because
then He caused them to know. But I remember that I discussed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[Pg 475]</a></span>
these modes of expression in the preceding books.
According to this will, then, by which we say that God wills
what He causes to be willed by others, from whom the future
is hidden, He wills many things which He does not perform.</p>

<p>Thus His saints, inspired by His holy will, desire many
things which never happen. They pray, <i>e.g.</i>, for certain individuals&mdash;they
pray in a pious and holy manner&mdash;but what
they request He does not perform, though He Himself by His
own Holy Spirit has wrought in them this will to pray. And
consequently, when the saints, in conformity with God's mind,
will and pray that all men be saved, we can use this mode of
expression: God wills and does not perform,&mdash;meaning that
He who causes them to will these things Himself wills them.
But if we speak of that will of His which is eternal as His
foreknowledge, certainly He has already done all things in
heaven and on earth that He has willed,&mdash;not only past and
present things, but even things still future. But before the
arrival of that time in which He has willed the occurrence of
what He foreknew and arranged before all time, we say, It
will happen when God wills. But if we are ignorant not
only of the time in which it is to be, but even whether it shall
be at all, we say, It will happen if God wills,&mdash;not because
God will then have a new will which He had not before, but
because that event, which from eternity has been prepared in
His unchangeable will, shall then come to pass.</p>


<p class="center">3. <i>Of the promise of eternal blessedness to the saints, and everlasting
punishment to the wicked.</i></p>

<p>Wherefore, not to mention many other instances besides, as
we now see in Christ the fulfilment of that which God promised
to Abraham when He said, "In thy seed shall all
nations be blessed,"<a name="FNanchor_966_966" id="FNanchor_966_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966_966" class="fnanchor">[966]</a> so this also shall be fulfilled which He
promised to the same race, when He said by the prophet,
"They that are in their sepulchres shall rise again;"<a name="FNanchor_967_967" id="FNanchor_967_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967_967" class="fnanchor">[967]</a> and
also, "There shall be a new heaven and a new earth: and the
former shall not be mentioned, nor come into mind; but they
shall find joy and rejoicing in it: for I will make Jerusalem
a rejoicing, and my people a joy. And I will rejoice in Jerusalem,
and joy in my people, and the voice of weeping shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[Pg 476]</a></span>
be no more heard in her."<a name="FNanchor_968_968" id="FNanchor_968_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968_968" class="fnanchor">[968]</a> And by another prophet He
uttered the same prediction: "At that time thy people shall
be delivered, every one that shall be found written in the book.
And many of them that sleep in the dust" (or, as some interpret
it, "in the mound") "of the earth shall awake, some to
everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt."<a name="FNanchor_969_969" id="FNanchor_969_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969_969" class="fnanchor">[969]</a>
And in another place by the same prophet: "The saints of
the Most High shall take the kingdom, and shall possess the
kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_970_970" id="FNanchor_970_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970_970" class="fnanchor">[970]</a> And a little
after he says, "His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom."<a name="FNanchor_971_971" id="FNanchor_971_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971_971" class="fnanchor">[971]</a>
Other prophecies referring to the same subject I have advanced
in the twentieth book, and others still which I have
not advanced are found written in the same Scriptures; and
these predictions shall be fulfilled, as those also have been
which unbelieving men supposed would be frustrate. For it
is the same God who promised both, and predicted that both
would come to pass,&mdash;the God whom the pagan deities tremble
before, as even Porphyry, the noblest of pagan philosophers,
testifies.</p>


<p class="center">4. <i>Against the wise men of the world, who fancy that the earthly bodies of men
cannot be transferred to a heavenly habitation.</i></p>

<p>But men who use their learning and intellectual ability to
resist the force of that great authority which, in fulfilment of
what was so long before predicted, has converted all races of
men to faith and hope in its promises, seem to themselves to
argue acutely against the resurrection of the body while they
cite what Cicero mentions in the third book <i>De Republica</i>.
For when he was asserting the apotheosis of Hercules and
Romulus, he says: "Whose bodies were not taken up into
heaven; for nature would not permit a body of earth to exist
anywhere except upon earth." This, forsooth, is the profound
reasoning of the wise men, whose thoughts God knows that
they are vain. For if we were only souls, that is, spirits
without any body, and if we dwelt in heaven and had no
knowledge of earthly animals, and were told that we should
be bound to earthly bodies by some wonderful bond of union,
and should animate them, should we not much more vigorously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">[Pg 477]</a></span>
refuse to believe this, and maintain that nature would
not permit an incorporeal substance to be held by a corporeal
bond? And yet the earth is full of living spirits, to which
terrestrial bodies are bound, and with which they are in a
wonderful way implicated. If, then, the same God who has
created such beings wills this also, what is to hinder the
earthly body from being raised to a heavenly body, since a
spirit, which is more excellent than all bodies, and consequently
than even a heavenly body, has been tied to an earthly
body? If so small an earthly particle has been able to hold
in union with itself something better than a heavenly body,
so as to receive sensation and life, will heaven disdain to
receive, or at least to retain, this sentient and living particle,
which derives its life and sensation from a substance more
excellent than any heavenly body? If this does not happen
now, it is because the time is not yet come which has been
determined by Him who has already done a much more marvellous
thing than that which these men refuse to believe.
For why do we not more intensely wonder that incorporeal
souls, which are of higher rank than heavenly bodies, are
bound to earthly bodies, rather than that bodies, although
earthly, are exalted to an abode which, though heavenly, is yet
corporeal, except because we have been accustomed to see
this, and indeed are this, while we are not as yet that other
marvel, nor have as yet ever seen it? Certainly, if we consult
sober reason, the more wonderful of the two divine works
is found to be to attach somehow corporeal things to incorporeal,
and not to connect earthly things with heavenly,
which, though diverse, are yet both of them corporeal.</p>


<p class="center">5. <i>Of the resurrection of the flesh, which some refuse to believe, though the
world at large believes it.</i></p>

<p>But granting that this was once incredible, behold, now, the
world has come to the belief that the earthly body of Christ
was received up into heaven. Already both the learned and
unlearned have believed in the resurrection of the flesh and
its ascension to the heavenly places, while only a very few
either of the educated or uneducated are still staggered by it.
If this is a credible thing which is believed, then let those
who do not believe see how stolid they are; and if it is incredible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[Pg 478]</a></span>
then this also is an incredible thing, that what is
incredible should have received such credit. Here then we
have two incredibles,&mdash;to wit, the resurrection of our body to
eternity, and that the world should believe so incredible a
thing; and both these incredibles the same God predicted
should come to pass before either had as yet occurred. We
see that already one of the two has come to pass, for the world
has believed what was incredible; why should we despair
that the remaining one shall also come to pass, and that this
which the world believed, though it was incredible, shall itself
occur? For already that which was equally incredible has
come to pass, in the world's believing an incredible thing.
Both were incredible: the one we see accomplished, the other
we believe shall be; for both were predicted in those same
Scriptures by means of which the world believed. And the
very manner in which the world's faith was won is found to
be even more incredible, if we consider it. Men uninstructed
in any branch of a liberal education, without any of the refinement
of heathen learning, unskilled in grammar, not armed
with dialectic, not adorned with rhetoric, but plain fishermen,
and very few in number,&mdash;these were the men whom Christ
sent with the nets of faith to the sea of this world, and thus
took out of every race so many fishes, and even the philosophers
themselves, wonderful as they are rare. Let us add, if
you please, or because you ought to be pleased, this third
incredible thing to the two former. And now we have three
incredibles, all of which have yet come to pass. It is incredible
that Jesus Christ should have risen in the flesh and
ascended with flesh into heaven; it is incredible that the
world should have believed so incredible a thing; it is incredible
that a very few men, of mean birth and the lowest
rank, and no education, should have been able so effectually
to persuade the world, and even its learned men, of so incredible
a thing. Of these three incredibles, the parties with
whom we are debating refuse to believe the first; they cannot
refuse to see the second, which they are unable to account for
if they do not believe the third. It is indubitable that the
resurrection of Christ, and His ascension into heaven with the
flesh in which He rose, is already preached and believed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[Pg 479]</a></span>
the whole world. If it is not credible, how is it that it has
already received credence in the whole world? If a number
of noble, exalted, and learned men had said that they had
witnessed it, and had been at pains to publish what they had
witnessed, it were not wonderful that the world should have
believed it, but it were very stubborn to refuse credence; but
if, as is true, the world has believed a few obscure, inconsiderable,
uneducated persons, who state and write that they
witnessed it, is it not unreasonable that a handful of wrong-headed
men should oppose themselves to the creed of the
whole world, and refuse their belief? And if the world has
put faith in a small number of men, of mean birth and the
lowest rank, and no education, it is because the divinity of the
thing itself appeared all the more manifestly in such contemptible
witnesses. The eloquence, indeed, which lent persuasion
to their message, consisted of wonderful works, not
words. For they who had not seen Christ risen in the flesh,
nor ascending into heaven with His risen body, believed those
who related how they had seen these things, and who testified
not only with words but wonderful signs. For men whom they
knew to be acquainted with only one, or at most two languages,
they marvelled to hear speaking in the tongues of all nations.
They saw a man, lame from his mother's womb, after forty
years stand up sound at their word in the name of Christ;
that handkerchiefs taken from their bodies had virtue to heal
the sick; that countless persons, sick of various diseases, were
laid in a row in the road where they were to pass, that their
shadow might fall on them as they walked, and that they
forthwith received health; that many other stupendous
miracles were wrought by them in the name of Christ; and,
finally, that they even raised the dead. If it be admitted
that these things occurred as they are related, then we have
a multitude of incredible things to add to those three incredibles.
That the one incredibility of the resurrection and
ascension of Jesus Christ may be believed, we accumulate the
testimonies of countless incredible miracles, but even so we
do not bend the frightful obstinacy of these sceptics. But if
they do not believe that these miracles were wrought by
Christ's apostles to gain credence to their preaching of His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[Pg 480]</a></span>
resurrection and ascension, this one grand miracle suffices for
us, that the whole world has believed without any miracles.</p>


<p class="center">6. <i>That Rome made its founder Romulus a god because it loved him; but the
Church loved Christ because it believed Him to be God.</i></p>

<p>Let us here recite the passage in which Tully expresses his
astonishment that the apotheosis of Romulus should have been
credited. I shall insert his words as they stand: "It is most
worthy of remark in Romulus, that other men who are said to
have become gods lived in less educated ages, when there was
a greater propensity to the fabulous, and when the uninstructed
were easily persuaded to believe anything. But the age of
Romulus was barely six hundred years ago, and already literature
and science had dispelled the errors that attach to an
uncultured age." And a little after he says of the same
Romulus words to this effect: "From this we may perceive
that Homer had flourished long before Romulus, and that there
was now so much learning in individuals, and so generally
diffused an enlightenment, that scarcely any room was left for
fable. For antiquity admitted fables, and sometimes even
very clumsy ones; but this age [of Romulus] was sufficiently
enlightened to reject whatever had not the air of truth." Thus
one of the most learned men, and certainly the most eloquent,
M. Tullius Cicero, says that it is surprising that the divinity
of Romulus was believed in, because the times were already so
enlightened that they would not accept a fabulous fiction. But
who believed that Romulus was a god except Rome, which was
itself small and in its infancy? Then afterwards it was necessary
that succeeding generations should preserve the tradition
of their ancestors; that, drinking in this superstition with their
mother's milk, the state might grow and come to such power
that it might dictate this belief, as from a point of vantage,
to all the nations over whom its sway extended. And these
nations, though they might not believe that Romulus was a
god, at least said so, that they might not give offence to their
sovereign state by refusing to give its founder that title which
was given him by Rome, which had adopted this belief, not by
a love of error, but an error of love. But though Christ is the
founder of the heavenly and eternal city, yet it did not believe
Him to be God because it was founded by Him, but rather it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[Pg 481]</a></span>
is founded by Him, in virtue of its belief. Rome, after it
had been built and dedicated, worshipped its founder in a
temple as a god; but this Jerusalem laid Christ, its God,
as its foundation, that the building and dedication might
proceed. The former city loved its founder, and therefore
believed him to be a god; the latter believed Christ to be God,
and therefore loved Him. There was an antecedent cause for
the love of the former city, and for its believing that even a
false dignity attached to the object of its love; so there was
an antecedent cause for the belief of the latter, and for its
loving the true dignity which a proper faith, not a rash surmise,
ascribed to its object. For, not to mention the multitude of
very striking miracles which proved that Christ is God, there
were also divine prophecies heralding Him, prophecies most
worthy of belief, which being already accomplished, we have
not, like the fathers, to wait for their verification. Of Romulus,
on the other hand, and of his building Rome and reigning in
it, we read or hear the narrative of what did take place, not
prediction which beforehand said that such things should be.
And so far as his reception among the gods is concerned, history
only records that this was believed, and does not state it
as a fact; for no miraculous signs testified to the truth of
this. For as to that wolf which is said to have nursed the
twin-brothers, and which is considered a great marvel, how
does this prove him to have been divine? For even supposing
that this nurse was a real wolf and not a mere courtezan,
yet she nursed both brothers, and Remus is not reckoned a
god. Besides, what was there to hinder any one from asserting
that Romulus or Hercules, or any such man, was a god?
Or who would rather choose to die than profess belief in his
divinity? And did a single nation worship Romulus among
its gods, unless it were forced through fear of the Roman
name? But who can number the multitudes who have chosen
death in the most cruel shapes rather than deny the divinity
of Christ? And thus the dread of some slight indignation,
which it was supposed, perhaps groundlessly, might exist in the
minds of the Romans, constrained some states who were subject
to Rome to worship Romulus as a god; whereas the dread,
not of a slight mental shock, but of severe and various punishments,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">[Pg 482]</a></span>
and of death itself, the most formidable of all, could not
prevent an immense multitude of martyrs throughout the world
from not merely worshipping but also confessing Christ as God.
The city of Christ, which, although as yet a stranger upon
earth, had countless hosts of citizens, did not make war upon
its godless persecutors for the sake of temporal security, but
preferred to win eternal salvation by abstaining from war.
They were bound, imprisoned, beaten, tortured, burned, torn
in pieces, massacred, and yet they multiplied. It was not
given to them to fight for their eternal salvation except by
despising their temporal salvation for their Saviour's sake.</p>

<p>I am aware that Cicero, in the third book of his <i>De Republica</i>,
if I mistake not, argues that a first-rate power will not
engage in war except either for honour or for safety. What
he has to say about the question of safety, and what he means
by safety, he explains in another place, saying, "Private persons
frequently evade, by a speedy death, destitution, exile,
bonds, the scourge, and the other pains which even the most
insensible feel. But to states, death, which seems to emancipate
individuals from all punishments, is itself a punishment;
for a state should be so constituted as to be eternal. And
thus death is not natural to a republic as to a man, to whom
death is not only necessary, but often even desirable. But
when a state is destroyed, obliterated, annihilated, it is as if
(to compare great things with small) this whole world perished
and collapsed." Cicero said this because he, with the Platonists,
believed that the world would not perish. It is therefore
agreed that, according to Cicero, a state should engage in
war for the safety which preserves the state permanently in
existence, though its citizens change; as the foliage of an olive
or laurel, or any tree of this kind, is perennial, the old leaves
being replaced by fresh ones. For death, as he says, is no
punishment to individuals, but rather delivers them from all
other punishments, but it is a punishment to the state. And
therefore it is reasonably asked whether the Saguntines did
right when they chose that their whole state should perish
rather than that they should break faith with the Roman
republic; for this deed of theirs is applauded by the citizens
of the earthly republic. But I do not see how they could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">[Pg 483]</a></span>
follow the advice of Cicero, who tells us that no war is to be
undertaken save for safety or for honour; neither does he say
which of these two is to be preferred, if a case should occur
in which the one could not be preserved without the loss of
the other. For manifestly, if the Saguntines chose safety, they
must break faith; if they kept faith, they must reject safety;
as also it fell out. But the safety of the city of God is such
that it can be retained, or rather acquired, by faith and with
faith; but if faith be abandoned, no one can attain it. It is
this thought of a most stedfast and patient spirit that has
made so many noble martyrs, while Romulus has not had, and
could not have, so much as one to die for his divinity.</p>


<p class="center">7. <i>That the world's belief in Christ is the result of divine power, not of human
persuasion.</i></p>

<p>But it is thoroughly ridiculous to make mention of the false
divinity of Romulus as any way comparable to that of Christ.
Nevertheless, if Romulus lived about six hundred years before
Cicero, in an age which already was so enlightened that it
rejected all impossibilities, how much more, in an age which
certainly was more enlightened, being six hundred years later,
the age of Cicero himself, and of the emperors Augustus and
Tiberius, would the human mind have refused to listen to or
believe in the resurrection of Christ's body and its ascension
into heaven, and have scouted it as an impossibility, had not
the divinity of the truth itself, or the truth of the divinity, and
corroborating miraculous signs, proved that it could happen
and had happened? Through virtue of these testimonies, and
notwithstanding the opposition and terror of so many cruel
persecutions, the resurrection and immortality of the flesh,
first in Christ, and subsequently in all in the new world, was
believed, was intrepidly proclaimed, and was sown over the
whole world, to be fertilized richly with the blood of the
martyrs. For the predictions of the prophets that had preceded
the events were read, they were corroborated by powerful
signs, and the truth was seen to be not contradictory to
reason, but only different from customary ideas, so that at
length the world embraced the faith it had furiously persecuted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">[Pg 484]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">8. <i>Of miracles which were wrought that the world might believe in Christ,
and which have not ceased since the world believed.</i></p>

<p>Why, they say, are those miracles, which you affirm were
wrought formerly, wrought no longer? I might, indeed, reply
that miracles were necessary before the world believed, in order
that it might believe. And whoever now-a-days demands to
see prodigies that he may believe, is himself a great prodigy,
because he does not believe, though the whole world does.
But they make these objections for the sole purpose of insinuating
that even those former miracles were never wrought.
How, then, is it that everywhere Christ is celebrated with
such firm belief in His resurrection and ascension? How is it
that in enlightened times, in which every impossibility is rejected,
the world has, without any miracles, believed things
marvellously incredible? Or will they say that these things
were credible, and therefore were credited? Why then do
they themselves not believe? Our argument, therefore, is a
summary one&mdash;either incredible things which were not witnessed
have caused the world to believe other incredible things
which both occurred and were witnessed, or this matter was
so credible that it needed no miracles in proof of it, and therefore
convicts these unbelievers of unpardonable scepticism.
This I might say for the sake of refuting these most frivolous
objectors. But we cannot deny that many miracles were
wrought to confirm that one grand and health-giving miracle
of Christ's ascension to heaven with the flesh in which He
rose. For these most trustworthy books of ours contain in
one narrative both the miracles that were wrought and the
creed which they were wrought to confirm. The miracles
were published that they might produce faith, and the faith
which they produced brought them into greater prominence.
For they are read in congregations that they may be believed,
and yet they would not be so read unless they were believed.
For even now miracles are wrought in the name of Christ,
whether by His sacraments or by the prayers or relics of His
saints; but they are not so brilliant and conspicuous as to
cause them to be published with such glory as accompanied
the former miracles. For the canon of the sacred writings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[Pg 485]</a></span>
which behoved to be closed,<a name="FNanchor_972_972" id="FNanchor_972_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972_972" class="fnanchor">[972]</a> causes those to be everywhere
recited, and to sink into the memory of all the congregations;
but these modern miracles are scarcely known even to the
whole population in the midst of which they are wrought, and
at the best are confined to one spot. For frequently they are
known only to a very few persons, while all the rest are ignorant
of them, especially if the state is a large one; and when
they are reported to other persons in other localities, there is
no sufficient authority to give them prompt and unwavering
credence, although they are reported to the faithful by the
faithful.</p>

<p>The miracle which was wrought at Milan when I was there,
and by which a blind man was restored to sight, could come
to the knowledge of many; for not only is the city a large one,
but also the emperor was there at the time, and the occurrence
was witnessed by an immense concourse of people that had
gathered to the bodies of the martyrs Protasius and Gervasius,
which had long lain concealed and unknown, but were now
made known to the bishop Ambrose in a dream, and discovered
by him. By virtue of these remains the darkness of that blind
man was scattered, and he saw the light of day.<a name="FNanchor_973_973" id="FNanchor_973_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973_973" class="fnanchor">[973]</a></p>

<p>But who but a very small number are aware of the cure
which was wrought upon Innocentius, ex-advocate of the deputy
prefecture, a cure wrought at Carthage, in my presence, and
under my own eyes? For when I and my brother Alypius,<a name="FNanchor_974_974" id="FNanchor_974_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974_974" class="fnanchor">[974]</a> who
were not yet clergymen,<a name="FNanchor_975_975" id="FNanchor_975_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975_975" class="fnanchor">[975]</a> though already servants of God, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">[Pg 486]</a></span>
from abroad, this man received us, and made us live with
him, for he and all his household were devotedly pious. He
was being treated by medical men for fistul√¶, of which he
had a large number intricately seated in the rectum. He had
already undergone an operation, and the surgeons were using
every means at their command for his relief. In that operation
he had suffered long-continued and acute pain; yet, among
the many folds of the gut, one had escaped the operators so
entirely, that, though they ought to have laid it open with the
knife, they never touched it. And thus, though all those that
had been opened were cured, this one remained as it was, and
frustrated all their labour. The patient, having his suspicions
awakened by the delay thus occasioned, and fearing greatly a
second operation, which another medical man&mdash;one of his own
domestics&mdash;had told him he must undergo, though this man
had not even been allowed to witness the first operation, and
had been banished from the house, and with difficulty allowed
to come back to his enraged master's presence,&mdash;the patient, I
say, broke out to the surgeons, saying, "Are you going to cut
me again? Are you, after all, to fulfil the prediction of that
man whom you would not allow even to be present?" The
surgeons laughed at the unskilful doctor, and soothed their
patient's fears with fair words and promises. So several days
passed, and yet nothing they tried did him good. Still they
persisted in promising that they would cure that fistula by
drugs, without the knife. They called in also another old
practitioner of great repute in that department, Ammonius (for
he was still alive at that time); and he, after examining the
part, promised the same result as themselves from their care
and skill. On this great authority, the patient became confident,
and, as if already well, vented his good spirits in facetious
remarks at the expense of his domestic physician, who had predicted
a second operation. To make a long story short, after
a number of days had thus uselessly elapsed, the surgeons,
wearied and confused, had at last to confess that he could only
be cured by the knife. Agitated with excessive fear, he was
terrified, and grew pale with dread; and when he collected
himself and was able to speak, he ordered them to go away
and never to return. Worn out with weeping, and driven by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[Pg 487]</a></span>
necessity, it occurred to him to call in an Alexandrian, who
was at that time esteemed a wonderfully skilful operator, that
he might perform the operation his rage would not suffer them
to do. But when he had come, and examined with a professional
eye the traces of their careful work, he acted the
part of a good man, and persuaded his patient to allow those
same hands the satisfaction of finishing his cure which had
begun it with a skill that excited his admiration, adding that
there was no doubt his only hope of a cure was by an operation,
but that it was thoroughly inconsistent with his nature
to win the credit of the cure by doing the little that remained
to be done, and rob of their reward men whose consummate
skill, care, and diligence he could not but admire when he saw
the traces of their work. They were therefore again received
to favour; and it was agreed that, in the presence of the
Alexandrian, they should operate on the fistula, which, by the
consent of all, could now only be cured by the knife. The
operation was deferred till the following day. But when they
had left, there arose in the house such a wailing, in sympathy
with the excessive despondency of the master, that it seemed
to us like the mourning at a funeral, and we could scarcely
repress it. Holy men were in the habit of visiting him daily;
Saturninus of blessed memory, at that time bishop of Uzali,
and the presbyter Gelosus, and the deacons of the church of
Carthage; and among these was the bishop Aurelius, who
alone of them all survives,&mdash;a man to be named by us with due
reverence,&mdash;and with him I have often spoken of this affair,
as we conversed together about the wonderful works of God,
and I have found that he distinctly remembers what I am
now relating. When these persons visited him that evening
according to their custom, he besought them, with pitiable
tears, that they would do him the honour of being present next
day at what he judged his funeral rather than his suffering.
For such was the terror his former pains had produced, that he
made no doubt he would die in the hands of the surgeons.
They comforted him, and exhorted him to put his trust in
God, and nerve his will like a man. Then we went to prayer;
but while we, in the usual way, were kneeling and bending
to the ground, he cast himself down, as if some one were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[Pg 488]</a></span>
hurling him violently to the earth, and began to pray; but in
what a manner, with what earnestness and emotion, with what
a flood of tears, with what groans and sobs, that shook his
whole body, and almost prevented him speaking, who can
describe! Whether the others prayed, and had not their
attention wholly diverted by this conduct, I do not know. For
myself, I could not pray at all. This only I briefly said in my
heart: "O Lord, what prayers of Thy people dost Thou hear
if Thou hearest not these?" For it seemed to me that nothing
could be added to this prayer, unless he expired in praying.
We rose from our knees, and, receiving the blessing of the
bishop, departed, the patient beseeching his visitors to be present
next morning, they exhorting him to keep up his heart.
The dreaded day dawned. The servants of God were present,
as they had promised to be; the surgeons arrived; all
that the circumstances required was ready; the frightful
instruments are produced; all look on in wonder and suspense.
While those who have most influence with the patient are
cheering his fainting spirit, his limbs are arranged on the
couch so as to suit the hand of the operator; the knots of the
bandages are untied; the part is bared; the surgeon examines
it, and, with knife in hand, eagerly looks for the sinus that is
to be cut. He searches for it with his eyes; he feels for it
with his finger; he applies every kind of scrutiny: he finds a
perfectly firm cicatrix! No words of mine can describe the
joy, and praise, and thanksgiving to the merciful and almighty
God which was poured from the lips of all, with tears of gladness.
Let the scene be imagined rather than described!</p>

<p>In the same city of Carthage lived Innocentia, a very
devout woman of the highest rank in the state. She had
cancer in one of her breasts, a disease which, as physicians
say, is incurable. Ordinarily, therefore, they either amputate,
and so separate from the body the member on which the disease
has seized, or, that the patient's life may be prolonged a little,
though death is inevitable even if somewhat delayed, they
abandon all remedies, following, as they say, the advice of
Hippocrates. This the lady we speak of had been advised to
by a skilful physician, who was intimate with her family; and
she betook herself to God alone by prayer. On the approach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[Pg 489]</a></span>
of Easter, she was instructed in a dream to wait for the first
woman that came out from the baptistery<a name="FNanchor_976_976" id="FNanchor_976_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976_976" class="fnanchor">[976]</a> after being baptized,
and to ask her to make the sign of Christ upon her sore. She
did so, and was immediately cured. The physician who had
advised her to apply no remedy if she wished to live a little
longer, when he had examined her after this, and found that
she who, on his former examination, was afflicted with that
disease was now perfectly cured, eagerly asked her what
remedy she had used, anxious, as we may well believe, to discover
the drug which should defeat the decision of Hippocrates.
But when she told him what had happened, he is said to have
replied, with religious politeness, though with a contemptuous
tone, and an expression which made her fear he would utter
some blasphemy against Christ, "I thought you would make
some great discovery to me." She, shuddering at his indifference,
quickly replied, "What great thing was it for Christ to
heal a cancer, who raised one who had been four days dead?"
When, therefore, I had heard this, I was extremely indignant
that so great a miracle, wrought in that well-known city, and
on a person who was certainly not obscure, should not be
divulged, and I considered that she should be spoken to, if
not reprimanded on this score. And when she replied to me
that she had not kept silence on the subject, I asked the
women with whom she was best acquainted whether they had
ever heard of this before. They told me they knew nothing
of it. "See," I said, "what your not keeping silence amounts
to, since not even those who are so familiar with you know of it."
And as I had only briefly heard the story, I made her tell
how the whole thing happened, from beginning to end, while
the other women listened in great astonishment, and glorified
God.</p>

<p>A gouty doctor of the same city, when he had given in his
name for baptism, and had been prohibited the day before
his baptism from being baptized that year, by black woolly-haired
boys who appeared to him in his dreams, and whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[Pg 490]</a></span>
he understood to be devils, and when, though they trod on
his feet, and inflicted the acutest pain he had ever yet experienced,
he refused to obey them, but overcame them, and
would not defer being washed in the laver of regeneration,
was relieved in the very act of baptism, not only of the extraordinary
pain he was tortured with, but also of the disease
itself, so that, though he lived a long time afterwards, he
never suffered from gout; and yet who knows of this miracle?
We, however, do know it, and so, too, do the small number of
brethren who were in the neighbourhood, and to whose ears
it might come.</p>

<p>An old comedian of Curubis<a name="FNanchor_977_977" id="FNanchor_977_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977_977" class="fnanchor">[977]</a> was cured at baptism not
only of paralysis, but also of hernia, and, being delivered from
both afflictions, came up out of the font of regeneration as
if he had had nothing wrong with his body. Who outside of
Curubis knows of this, or who but a very few who might
hear it elsewhere? But we, when we heard of it, made
the man come to Carthage, by order of the holy bishop
Aurelius, although we had already ascertained the fact on the
information of persons whose word we could not doubt.</p>

<p>Hesperius, of a tribunitian family, and a neighbour of our
own,<a name="FNanchor_978_978" id="FNanchor_978_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978_978" class="fnanchor">[978]</a> has a farm called Zubedi in the Fussalian district;<a name="FNanchor_979_979" id="FNanchor_979_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979_979" class="fnanchor">[979]</a>
and, finding that his family, his cattle, and his servants were
suffering from the malice of evil spirits, he asked our presbyters,
during my absence, that one of them would go with
him and banish the spirits by his prayers. One went, offered
there the sacrifice of the body of Christ, praying with all
his might that that vexation might cease. It did cease forthwith,
through God's mercy. Now he had received from a
friend of his own some holy earth brought from Jerusalem,
where Christ, having been buried, rose again the third day.
This earth he had hung up in his bedroom to preserve himself
from harm. But when his house was purged of that
demoniacal invasion, he began to consider what should be
done with the earth; for his reverence for it made him unwilling
to have it any longer in his bedroom. It so happened
that I and Maximinus bishop of Synita, and then my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[Pg 491]</a></span>
colleague, were in the neighbourhood. Hesperius asked us
to visit him, and we did so. When he had related all the
circumstances, he begged that the earth might be buried
somewhere, and that the spot should be made a place of
prayer where Christians might assemble for the worship of
God. We made no objection: it was done as he desired.
There was in that neighbourhood a young countryman who
was paralytic, who, when he heard of this, begged his parents
to take him without delay to that holy place. When he had
been brought there, he prayed, and forthwith went away on
his own feet perfectly cured.</p>

<p>There is a country-seat called Victoriana, less than thirty
miles from Hippo-regius. At it there is a monument to the
Milanese martyrs, Protasius and Gervasius. Thither a young
man was carried, who, when he was watering his horse one
summer day at noon in a pool of a river, had been taken
possession of by a devil. As he lay at the monument, near
death, or even quite like a dead person, the lady of the manor,
with her maids and religious attendants, entered the place
for evening prayer and praise, as her custom was, and they
began to sing hymns. At this sound the young man, as if
electrified, was thoroughly aroused, and with frightful screaming
seized the altar, and held it as if he did not dare or were
not able to let it go, and as if he were fixed or tied to it;
and the devil in him, with loud lamentation, besought that
he might be spared, and confessed where and when and how
he took possession of the youth. At last, declaring that he
would go out of him, he named one by one the parts of his
body which he threatened to mutilate as he went out; and
with these words he departed from the man. But his eye,
falling out on his cheek, hung by a slender vein as by a root,
and the whole of the pupil which had been black became
white. When this was witnessed by those present (others
too had now gathered to his cries, and had all joined in
prayer for him), although they were delighted that he had
recovered his sanity of mind, yet, on the other hand, they
were grieved about his eye, and said he should seek medical
advice. But his sister's husband, who had brought him
there, said, "God, who has banished the devil, is able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[Pg 492]</a></span>
restore his eye at the prayers of His saints." Therewith he
replaced the eye that was fallen out and hanging, and bound
it in its place with his handkerchief as well as he could, and
advised him not to loose the bandage for seven days. When
he did so, he found it quite healthy. Others also were cured
there, but of them it were tedious to speak.</p>

<p>I know that a young woman of Hippo was immediately
dispossessed of a devil, on anointing herself with oil mixed
with the tears of the presbyter who had been praying for
her. I know also that a bishop once prayed for a demoniac
young man whom he never saw, and that he was cured on
the spot.</p>

<p>There was a fellow-townsman of ours at Hippo, Florentius,
an old man, religious and poor, who supported himself as a
tailor. Having lost his coat, and not having means to buy
another, he prayed to the Twenty Martyrs,<a name="FNanchor_980_980" id="FNanchor_980_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980_980" class="fnanchor">[980]</a> who have a very
celebrated memorial shrine in our town, begging in a distinct
voice that he might be clothed. Some scoffing young men,
who happened to be present, heard him, and followed him
with their sarcasm as he went away, as if he had asked the
martyrs for fifty pence to buy a coat. But he, walking on in
silence, saw on the shore a great fish, gasping as if just cast
up, and having secured it with the good-natured assistance of
the youths, he sold it for curing to a cook of the name of
Catosus, a good Christian man, telling him how he had come
by it, and receiving for it three hundred pence, which he laid
out in wool, that his wife might exercise her skill upon, and
make into a coat for him. But, on cutting up the fish, the
cook found a gold ring in its belly; and forthwith, moved
with compassion, and influenced, too, by religious fear, gave it
up to the man, saying, "See how the Twenty Martyrs have
clothed you."</p>

<p>When the bishop Projectus was bringing the relics of the
most glorious martyr Stephen to the waters of Tibilis, a great
concourse of people came to meet him at the shrine. There
a blind woman entreated that she might be led to the bishop
who was carrying the relics. He gave her the flowers he
was carrying. She took them, applied them to her eyes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[Pg 493]</a></span>
forthwith saw. Those who were present were astounded,
while she, with every expression of joy, preceded them, pursuing
her way without further need of a guide.</p>

<p>Lucillus bishop of Sinita, in the neighbourhood of the
colonial town of Hippo, was carrying in procession some
relics of the same martyr, which had been deposited in the
castle of Sinita. A fistula under which he had long laboured,
and which his private physician was watching an opportunity
to cut, was suddenly cured by the mere carrying of that
sacred fardel,<a name="FNanchor_981_981" id="FNanchor_981_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981_981" class="fnanchor">[981]</a>&mdash;at least, afterwards there was no trace of it
in his body.</p>

<p>Eucharius, a Spanish priest, residing at Calama, was for a
long time a sufferer from stone. By the relics of the same
martyr, which the bishop Possidius brought him, he was
cured. Afterwards the same priest, sinking under another
disease, was lying dead, and already they were binding his
hands. By the succour of the same martyr he was raised to
life, the priest's cloak having been brought from the oratory
and laid upon the corpse.</p>

<p>There was there an old nobleman named Martial, who had
a great aversion to the Christian religion, but whose daughter
was a Christian, while her husband had been baptized that
same year. When he was ill, they besought him with tears
and prayers to become a Christian, but he positively refused,
and dismissed them from his presence in a storm of indignation.
It occurred to the son-in-law to go to the oratory of
St. Stephen, and there pray for him with all earnestness that
God might give him a right mind, so that he should not
delay believing in Christ. This he did with great groaning
and tears, and the burning fervour of sincere piety; then, as
he left the place, he took some of the flowers that were lying
there, and, as it was already night, laid them by his father's
head, who so slept. And lo! before dawn, he cries out for
some one to run for the bishop; but he happened at that
time to be with me at Hippo. So when he had heard that
he was from home, he asked the presbyters to come. They
came. To the joy and amazement of all, he declared that he
believed, and he was baptized. As long as he remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[Pg 494]</a></span>
life, these words were ever on his lips: "Christ, receive my
spirit," though he was not aware that these were the last
words of the most blessed Stephen when he was stoned by
the Jews. They were his last words also, for not long after
he himself also gave up the ghost.</p>

<p>There, too, by the same martyr, two men, one a citizen, the
other a stranger, were cured of gout; but while the citizen
was absolutely cured, the stranger was only informed what he
should apply when the pain returned; and when he followed
this advice, the pain was at once relieved.</p>

<p>Audurus is the name of an estate, where there is a church
that contains a memorial shrine of the martyr Stephen. It
happened that, as a little boy was playing in the court, the
oxen drawing a waggon went out of the track and crushed
him with the wheel, so that immediately he seemed at his
last gasp. His mother snatched him up, and laid him at the
shrine, and not only did he revive, but also appeared uninjured.</p>

<p>A religious female, who lived at Caspalium, a neighbouring
estate, when she was so ill as to be despaired of, had her dress
brought to this shrine, but before it was brought back she was
gone. However, her parents wrapped her corpse in the dress,
and, her breath returning, she became quite well.</p>

<p>At Hippo a Syrian called Bassus was praying at the relics
of the same martyr for his daughter, who was dangerously ill.
He too had brought her dress with him to the shrine. But
as he prayed, behold, his servants ran from the house to tell
him she was dead. His friends, however, intercepted them,
and forbade them to tell him, lest he should bewail her in
public. And when he had returned to his house, which was
already ringing with the lamentations of his family, and had
thrown on his daughter's body the dress he was carrying,
she was restored to life.</p>

<p>There, too, the son of a man, Iren√¶us, one of our tax-gatherers,
took ill and died. And while his body was lying
lifeless, and the last rites were being prepared, amidst the
weeping and mourning of all, one of the friends who were
consoling the father suggested that the body should be
anointed with the oil of the same martyr. It was done, and
he revived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">[Pg 495]</a></span></p>

<p>Likewise Eleusinus, a man of tribunitian rank among us,
laid his infant son, who had died, on the shrine of the martyr,
which is in the suburb where he lived, and, after prayer,
which he poured out there with many tears, he took up his
child alive.</p>

<p>What am I to do? I am so pressed by the promise of
finishing this work, that I cannot record all the miracles I
know; and doubtless several of our adherents, when they
read what I have narrated, will regret that I have omitted
so many which they, as well as I, certainly know. Even now
I beg these persons to excuse me, and to consider how long it
would take me to relate all those miracles, which the necessity
of finishing the work I have undertaken forces me to omit.
For were I to be silent of all others, and to record exclusively
the miracles of healing which were wrought in the district of
Calama and of Hippo by means of this martyr&mdash;I mean the
most glorious Stephen&mdash;they would fill many volumes; and
yet all even of these could not be collected, but only those of
which narratives have been written for public recital. For
when I saw, in our own times, frequent signs of the presence
of divine powers similar to those which had been given of
old, I desired that narratives might be written, judging that
the multitude should not remain ignorant of these things. It
is not yet two years since these relics were first brought to
Hippo-regius, and though many of the miracles which have
been wrought by it have not, as I have the most certain
means of knowing, been recorded, those which have been
published amount to almost seventy at the hour at which I
write. But at Calama, where these relics have been for a
longer time, and where more of the miracles were narrated
for public information, there are incomparably more.</p>

<p>At Uzali, too, a colony near Utica, many signal miracles
were, to my knowledge, wrought by the same martyr, whose
relics had found a place there by direction of the bishop
Evodius, long before we had them at Hippo. But there the
custom of publishing narratives does not obtain, or, I should
say, did not obtain, for possibly it may now have been begun.
For, when I was there recently, a woman of rank, Petronia,
had been miraculously cured of a serious illness of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[Pg 496]</a></span>
standing, in which all medical appliances had failed, and, with
the consent of the above-named bishop of the place, I exhorted
her to publish an account of it that might be read to the
people. She most promptly obeyed, and inserted in her
narrative a circumstance which I cannot omit to mention,
though I am compelled to hasten on to the subjects which
this work requires me to treat. She said that she had been
persuaded by a Jew to wear next her skin, under all her
clothes, a hair girdle, and on this girdle a ring, which, instead
of a gem, had a stone which had been found in the kidneys of
an ox. Girt with this charm, she was making her way to
the threshold of the holy martyr. But, after leaving Carthage,
and when she had been lodging in her own demesne on the
river Bagrada, and was now rising to continue her journey,
she saw her ring lying before her feet. In great surprise
she examined the hair girdle, and when she found it bound, as
it had been, quite firmly with knots, she conjectured that the
ring had been worn through and dropped off; but when she
found that the ring was itself also perfectly whole, she presumed
that by this great miracle she had received somehow
a pledge of her cure, whereupon she untied the girdle, and
cast it into the river, and the ring along with it. This is not
credited by those who do not believe either that the Lord
Jesus Christ came forth from His mother's womb without
destroying her virginity, and entered among His disciples
when the doors were shut; but let them make strict inquiry
into this miracle, and if they find it true, let them believe
those others. The lady is of distinction, nobly born, married
to a nobleman. She resides at Carthage. The city is distinguished,
the person is distinguished, so that they who make
inquiries cannot fail to find satisfaction. Certainly the martyr
himself, by whose prayers she was healed, believed on the Son
of her who remained a virgin; on Him who came in among
the disciples when the doors were shut; in fine,&mdash;and to this
tends all that we have been retailing,&mdash;on Him who ascended
into heaven with the flesh in which He had risen; and it is
because he laid down his life for this faith that such miracles
were done by his means.</p>

<p>Even now, therefore, many miracles are wrought, the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[Pg 497]</a></span>
God who wrought those we read of still performing them, by
whom He will and as He will; but they are not as well
known, nor are they beaten into the memory, like gravel, by
frequent reading, so that they cannot fall out of mind. For
even where, as is now done among ourselves, care is taken
that the pamphlets of those who receive benefit be read
publicly, yet those who are present hear the narrative but
once, and many are absent; and so it comes to pass that even
those who are present forget in a few days what they heard,
and scarcely one of them can be found who will tell what he
heard to one who he knows was not present.</p>

<p>One miracle was wrought among ourselves, which, though
no greater than those I have mentioned, was yet so signal
and conspicuous, that I suppose there is no inhabitant of
Hippo who did not either see or hear of it, none who could
possibly forget it. There were seven brothers and three sisters
of a noble family of the Cappadocian C√¶sarea, who were cursed
by their mother, a new-made widow, on account of some
wrong they had done her, and which she bitterly resented, and
who were visited with so severe a punishment from Heaven,
that all of them were seized with a hideous shaking in all
their limbs. Unable, while presenting this loathsome appearance,
to endure the eyes of their fellow-citizens, they wandered
over almost the whole Roman world, each following his own
direction. Two of them came to Hippo, a brother and a sister,
Paulus and Palladia, already known in many other places by
the fame of their wretched lot. Now it was about fifteen
days before Easter when they came, and they came daily to
church, and specially to the relics of the most glorious Stephen,
praying that God might now be appeased, and restore their
former health. There, and wherever they went, they attracted
the attention of every one. Some who had seen them elsewhere,
and knew the cause of their trembling, told others as
occasion offered. Easter arrived, and on the Lord's day, in
the morning, when there was now a large crowd present, and
the young man was holding the bars of the holy place where
the relics were, and praying, suddenly he fell down, and lay
precisely as if asleep, but not trembling as he was wont to
do even in sleep. All present were astonished. Some were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">[Pg 498]</a></span>
alarmed, some were moved with pity; and while some were
for lifting him up, others prevented them, and said they should
rather wait and see what would result. And behold! he rose
up, and trembled no more, for he was healed, and stood quite
well, scanning those who were scanning him. Who then
refrained himself from praising God? The whole church was
filled with the voices of those who were shouting and congratulating
him. Then they came running to me, where I
was sitting ready to come into the church. One after another
they throng in, the last comer telling me as news what the
first had told me already; and while I rejoiced and inwardly
gave God thanks, the young man himself also enters, with a
number of others, falls at my knees, is raised up to receive
my kiss. We go in to the congregation: the church was
full, and ringing with the shouts of joy, "Thanks to God!
Praised be God!" every one joining and shouting on all sides,
"I have healed the people," and then with still louder voice
shouting again. Silence being at last obtained, the customary
lessons of the divine Scriptures were read. And when I came
to my sermon, I made a few remarks suitable to the occasion
and the happy and joyful feeling, not desiring them to listen
to me, but rather to consider the eloquence of God in this
divine work. The man dined with us, and gave us a careful
account of his own, his mother's, and his family's calamity.
Accordingly, on the following day, after delivering my sermon,
I promised that next day I would read his narrative to the
people.<a name="FNanchor_982_982" id="FNanchor_982_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982_982" class="fnanchor">[982]</a> And when I did so, the third day after Easter Sunday,
I made the brother and sister both stand on the steps of
the raised place from which I used to speak; and while they
stood there their pamphlet was read.<a name="FNanchor_983_983" id="FNanchor_983_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983_983" class="fnanchor">[983]</a> The whole congregation,
men and women alike, saw the one standing without any
unnatural movement, the other trembling in all her limbs;
so that those who had not before seen the man himself saw
in his sister what the divine compassion had removed from
him. In him they saw matter of congratulation, in her subject
for prayer. Meanwhile, their pamphlet being finished,
I instructed them to withdraw from the gaze of the people;
and I had begun to discuss the whole matter somewhat more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">[Pg 499]</a></span>
carefully, when lo! as I was proceeding, other voices are heard
from the tomb of the martyr, shouting new congratulations.
My audience turned round, and began to run to the tomb.
The young woman, when she had come down from the steps
where she had been standing, went to pray at the holy relics,
and no sooner had she touched the bars than she, in the same
way as her brother, collapsed, as if falling asleep, and rose
up cured. While, then, we were asking what had happened,
and what occasioned this noise of joy, they came into the
basilica where we were, leading her from the martyr's tomb
in perfect health. Then, indeed, such a shout of wonder rose
from men and women together, that the exclamations and the
tears seemed like never to come to an end. She was led to
the place where she had a little before stood trembling. They
now rejoiced that she was like her brother, as before they had
mourned that she remained unlike him; and as they had not
yet uttered their prayers in her behalf, they perceived that
their intention of doing so had been speedily heard. They
shouted God's praises without words, but with such a noise
that our ears could scarcely bear it. What was there in the
hearts of these exultant people but the faith of Christ, for
which Stephen had shed his blood?</p>


<p class="center">9. <i>That all the miracles which are done by means of the martyrs in the name of
Christ testify to that faith which the martyrs had in Christ.</i></p>

<p>To what do these miracles witness, but to this faith which
preaches Christ risen in the flesh, and ascended with the same
into heaven? For the martyrs themselves were martyrs, that
is to say, witnesses of this faith, drawing upon themselves by
their testimony the hatred of the world, and conquering the
world not by resisting it, but by dying. For this faith they
died, and can now ask these benefits from the Lord in whose
name they were slain. For this faith their marvellous constancy
was exercised, so that in these miracles great power
was manifested as the result. For if the resurrection of the
flesh to eternal life had not taken place in Christ, and were
not to be accomplished in His people, as predicted by Christ,
or by the prophets who foretold that Christ was to come,
why do the martyrs who were slain for this faith which proclaims
the resurrection possess such power? For whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">[Pg 500]</a></span>
God Himself wrought these miracles by that wonderful
manner of working by which, though Himself eternal, He
produces effects in time; or whether He wrought them by
servants, and if so, whether He made use of the spirits of
martyrs as He uses men who are still in the body, or effects
all these marvels by means of angels, over whom He exerts an
invisible, immutable, incorporeal sway, so that what is said to
be done by the martyrs is done not by their operation, but
only by their prayer and request; or whether, finally, some
things are done in one way, others in another, and so that
man cannot at all comprehend them,&mdash;nevertheless these
miracles attest this faith which preaches the resurrection of
the flesh to eternal life.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>10. <i>That the martyrs who obtain many miracles in order that the true God may
be worshipped, are worthy of much greater honour than the demons, who
do some marvels that they themselves may be supposed to be God.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Here perhaps our adversaries will say that their gods also
have done some wonderful things, if now they begin to compare
their gods to our dead men. Or will they also say that
they have gods taken from among dead men, such as Hercules,
Romulus, and many others whom they fancy to have been
received into the number of the gods? But our martyrs are
not our gods; for we know that the martyrs and we have
both but one God, and that the same. Nor yet are the
miracles which they maintain to have been done by means of
their temples at all comparable to those which are done by
the tombs of our martyrs. If they seem similar, their gods
have been defeated by our martyrs as Pharaoh's magi were by
Moses. In reality, the demons wrought these marvels with
the same impure pride with which they aspired to be the
gods of the nations; but the martyrs do these wonders, or
rather God does them while they pray and assist, in order
that an impulse may be given to the faith by which we believe
that they are not our gods, but have, together with ourselves,
one God. In fine, they built temples to these gods of theirs,
and set up altars, and ordained priests, and appointed sacrifices;
but to our martyrs we build, not temples as if they
were gods, but monuments as to dead men whose spirits live
with God. Neither do we erect altars at these monuments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">[Pg 501]</a></span>
that we may sacrifice to the martyrs, but to the one God of
the martyrs and of ourselves; and in this sacrifice they are
named in their own place and rank as men of God who conquered
the world by confessing Him, but they are not invoked
by the sacrificing priest. For it is to God, not to them, he
sacrifices, though he sacrifices at their monument; for he is
God's priest, not theirs. The sacrifice itself, too, is the body of
Christ, which is not offered to them, because they themselves
are this body. Which then can more readily be believed to
work miracles? They who wish themselves to be reckoned
gods by those on whom they work miracles, or those whose
sole object in working any miracle is to induce faith in God,
and in Christ also as God? They who wished to turn even
their crimes into sacred rites, or those who are unwilling
that even their own praises be consecrated, and seek that
everything for which they are justly praised be ascribed to
the glory of Him in whom they are praised? For in the Lord
their souls are praised. Let us therefore believe those who
both speak the truth and work wonders. For by speaking
the truth they suffered, and so won the power of working
wonders. And the leading truth they professed is that Christ
rose from the dead, and first showed in His own flesh the immortality
of the resurrection which He promised should be
ours, either in the beginning of the world to come, or in the
end of this world.</p>


<p class="center">11. <i>Against the Platonists, who argue from the physical weight of the elements
that an earthly body cannot inhabit heaven.</i></p>

<p>But against this great gift of God, these reasoners, "whose
thoughts the Lord knows that they are vain,"<a name="FNanchor_984_984" id="FNanchor_984_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984_984" class="fnanchor">[984]</a> bring arguments
from the weights of the elements; for they have been
taught by their master Plato that the two greatest elements of
the world, and the furthest removed from one another, are
coupled and united by the two intermediate, air and water.
And consequently they say, since the earth is the first of the
elements, beginning from the base of the series, the second
the water above the earth, the third the air above the water,
the fourth the heaven above the air, it follows that a body of
earth cannot live in the heaven; for each element is poised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>
by its own weight so as to preserve its own place and rank.
Behold with what arguments human infirmity, possessed with
vanity, contradicts the omnipotence of God! What, then, do
so many earthly bodies do in the air, since the air is the
third element from the earth? Unless perhaps He who has
granted to the earthly bodies of birds that they be carried
through the air by the lightness of feathers and wings, has
not been able to confer upon the bodies of men made immortal
the power to abide in the highest heaven. The earthly
animals, too, which cannot fly, among which are men, ought
on these terms to live under the earth, as fishes, which are
the animals of the water, live under the water. Why, then,
can an animal of earth not live in the second element, that is,
in water, while it can in the third? Why, though it belongs
to the earth, is it forthwith suffocated if it is forced to live in
the second element next above earth, while it lives in the
third, and cannot live out of it? Is there a mistake here in
the order of the elements, or is not the mistake rather in their
reasonings, and not in the nature of things? I will not repeat
what I said in the thirteenth book,<a name="FNanchor_985_985" id="FNanchor_985_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985_985" class="fnanchor">[985]</a> that many earthly
bodies, though heavy like lead, receive from the workman's
hand a form which enables them to swim in water; and
yet it is denied that the omnipotent Worker can confer on
the human body a property which shall enable it to pass into
heaven and dwell there.</p>

<p>But against what I have formerly said they can find
nothing to say, even though they introduce and make the
most of this order of the elements in which they confide.
For if the order be that the earth is first, the water second,
the air third, the heaven fourth, then the soul is above all.
For Aristotle said that the soul was a fifth body, while Plato
denied that it was a body at all. If it were a fifth body,
then certainly it would be above the rest; and if it is not a
body at all, so much the more does it rise above all. What,
then, does it do in an earthly body? What does this soul,
which is finer than all else, do in such a mass of matter as
this? What does the lightest of substances do in this ponderosity?
this swiftest substance in such sluggishness? Will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
not the body be raised to heaven by virtue of so excellent a
nature as this? and if now earthly bodies can retain the
souls below, shall not the souls be one day able to raise the
earthly bodies above?</p>

<p>If we pass now to their miracles which they oppose to
our martyrs as wrought by their gods, shall not even these
be found to make for us, and help out our argument? For
if any of the miracles of their gods are great, certainly
that is a great one which Varro mentions of a vestal virgin,
who, when she was endangered by a false accusation of unchastity,
filled a sieve with water from the Tiber, and carried
it to her judges without any part of it leaking. Who kept
the weight of water in the sieve? Who prevented any drop
from falling from it through so many open holes? They will
answer, Some god or some demon. If a god, is he greater
than the God who made the world? If a demon, is he
mightier than an angel who serves the God by whom the
world was made? If, then, a lesser god, angel, or demon could
so sustain the weight of this liquid element that the water
might seem to have changed its nature, shall not Almighty
God, who Himself created all the elements, be able to eliminate
from the earthly body its heaviness, so that the quickened
body shall dwell in whatever element the quickening spirit
pleases?</p>

<p>Then, again, since they give the air a middle place between
the fire above and the water beneath, how is it that we often
find it between water and water, and between the water and
the earth? For what do they make of those watery clouds,
between which and the seas air is constantly found intervening?
I should like to know by what weight and order of the
elements it comes to pass that very violent and stormy torrents
are suspended in the clouds above the earth before they rush
along upon the earth under the air? In fine, why is it that
throughout the whole globe the air is between the highest
heaven and the earth, if its place is between the sky and the
water, as the place of the water is between the sky and the
earth?</p>

<p>Finally, if the order of the elements is so disposed that,
as Plato thinks, the two extremes, fire and earth, are united<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>
by the two means, air and water, and that the fire occupies
the highest part of the sky, and the earth the lowest part, or
as it were the foundation of the world, and that therefore
earth cannot be in the heavens, how is fire in the earth?
For, according to this reasoning, these two elements, earth and
fire, ought to be so restricted to their own places, the highest
and the lowest, that neither the lowest can rise to the place
of the highest, nor the highest sink to that of the lowest.
Thus, as they think that no particle of earth is or shall ever
be in the sky, so we ought to see no particle of fire on the
earth. But the fact is that it exists to such an extent, not
only on but even under the earth, that the tops of mountains
vomit it forth; besides that we see it to exist on earth
for human uses, and even to be produced from the earth, since
it is kindled from wood and stones, which are without doubt
earthly bodies. But that [upper] fire, they say, is tranquil,
pure, harmless, eternal; but this [earthly] fire is turbid,
smoky, corruptible, and corrupting. But it does not corrupt
the mountains and caverns of the earth in which it rages
continually. But grant that the earthly fire is so unlike the
other as to suit its earthly position, why then do they object
to our believing that the nature of earthly bodies shall some
day be made incorruptible and fit for the sky, even as now
fire is corruptible and suited to the earth? They therefore
adduce from their weights and order of the elements nothing
from which they can prove that it is impossible for Almighty
God to make our bodies such that they can dwell in the
skies.</p>


<p class="center">12. <i>Against the calumnies with which unbelievers throw ridicule upon the Christian
faith in the resurrection of the flesh.</i></p>

<p>But their way is to feign a scrupulous anxiety in investigating
this question, and to cast ridicule on our faith in the
resurrection of the body, by asking, Whether abortions shall
rise? And as the Lord says, "Verily I say unto you, not
a hair of your head shall perish,"<a name="FNanchor_986_986" id="FNanchor_986_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986_986" class="fnanchor">[986]</a> shall all bodies have an
equal stature and strength, or shall there be differences in
size? For if there is to be equality, where shall those abortions,
supposing that they rise again, get that bulk which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>
they had not here? Or if they shall not rise because they
were not born but cast out, they raise the same question
about children who have died in childhood, asking us whence
they get the stature which we see they had not here; for
we will not say that those who have been not only born, but
born again, shall not rise again. Then, further, they ask of
what size these equal bodies shall be. For if all shall be as
tall and large as were the tallest and largest in this world,
they ask us how it is that not only children but many full-grown
persons shall receive what they here did not possess,
if each one is to receive what he had here. And if the saying
of the apostle, that we are all to come to the "measure
of the age of the fulness of Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_987_987" id="FNanchor_987_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987_987" class="fnanchor">[987]</a> or that other saying,
"Whom He predestinated to be conformed to the image of
His Son,"<a name="FNanchor_988_988" id="FNanchor_988_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988_988" class="fnanchor">[988]</a> is to be understood to mean that the stature and
size of Christ's body shall be the measure of the bodies of
all those who shall be in His kingdom, then, say they, the size
and height of many must be diminished; and if so much of
the bodily frame itself be lost, what becomes of the saying,
"Not a hair of your head shall perish?" Besides, it might
be asked regarding the hair itself, whether all that the barber
has cut off shall be restored? And if it is to be restored,
who would not shrink from such deformity? For as the
same restoration will be made of what has been pared off
the nails, much will be replaced on the body which a regard
for its appearance had cut off. And where, then, will be its
beauty, which assuredly ought to be much greater in that
immortal condition than it could be in this corruptible state?
On the other hand, if such things are not restored to the
body, they must perish; how, then, they say, shall not a hair
of the head perish? In like manner they reason about fatness
and leanness; for if all are to be equal, then certainly
there shall not be some fat, others lean. Some, therefore,
shall gain, others lose something. Consequently there will
not be a simple restoration of what formerly existed, but, on
the one hand, an addition of what had no existence, and, on
the other, a loss of what did before exist.</p>

<p>The difficulties, too, about the corruption and dissolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>
of dead bodies,&mdash;that one is turned into dust, while another
evaporates into the air; that some are devoured by beasts,
some by fire, while some perish by shipwreck or by drowning
in one shape or other, so that their bodies decay into liquid,&mdash;these
difficulties give them immoderate alarm, and they believe
that all those dissolved elements cannot be gathered again
and reconstructed into a body. They also make eager use of all
the deformities and blemishes which either accident or birth
has produced, and accordingly, with horror and derision, cite
monstrous births, and ask if every deformity will be preserved
in the resurrection. For if we say that no such thing shall
be reproduced in the body of a man, they suppose that they
confute us by citing the marks of the wounds which we assert
were found in the risen body of the Lord Christ. But of all
these, the most difficult question is, into whose body that
flesh shall return which has been eaten and assimilated by
another man constrained by hunger to use it so; for it has
been converted into the flesh of the man who used it as his
nutriment, and it filled up those losses of flesh which famine
had produced. For the sake, then, of ridiculing the resurrection,
they ask, Shall this return to the man whose flesh
it first was, or to him whose flesh it afterwards became?
And thus, too, they seek to give promise to the human soul
of alternations of true misery and false happiness, in accordance
with Plato's theory; or, in accordance with Porphyry's,
that, after many transmigrations into different bodies, it ends
its miseries, and never more returns to them, not, however,
by obtaining an immortal body, but by escaping from every
kind of body.</p>


<p class="center">13. <i>Whether abortions, if they are numbered among the dead, shall not also
have a part in the resurrection.</i></p>

<p>To these objections, then, of our adversaries which I have
thus detailed, I will now reply, trusting that God will mercifully
assist my endeavours. That abortions, which, even supposing
they were alive in the womb, did also die there, shall
rise again, I make bold neither to affirm nor to deny, although
I fail to see why, if they are not excluded from the number
of the dead, they should not attain to the resurrection of the
dead. For either all the dead shall not rise, and there will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span>
be to all eternity some souls without bodies, though they once
had them,&mdash;only in their mother's womb, indeed; or, if all
human souls shall receive again the bodies which they had
wherever they lived, and which they left when they died,
then I do not see how I can say that even those who died
in their mother's womb shall have no resurrection. But
whichever of these opinions any one may adopt concerning
them, we must at least apply to them, if they rise again, all
that we have to say of infants who have been born.</p>


<p class="center">14. <i>Whether infants shall rise in that body which they would have had had they
grown up.</i></p>

<p>What, then, are we to say of infants, if not that they will
not rise in that diminutive body in which they died, but
shall receive by the marvellous and rapid operation of God
that body which time by a slower process would have given
them? For in the Lord's words, where He says, "Not a hair
of your head shall perish,"<a name="FNanchor_989_989" id="FNanchor_989_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989_989" class="fnanchor">[989]</a> it is asserted that nothing which
was possessed shall be wanting; but it is not said that nothing
which was not possessed shall be given. To the dead infant
there was wanting the perfect stature of its body; for even
the perfect infant lacks the perfection of bodily size, being
capable of further growth. This perfect stature is, in a sense,
so possessed by all that they are conceived and born with it,&mdash;that
is, they have it potentially, though not yet in actual
bulk; just as all the members of the body are potentially in
the seed, though, even after the child is born, some of them,
the teeth for example, may be wanting. In this seminal
principle of every substance, there seems to be, as it were,
the beginning of everything which does not yet exist, or
rather does not appear, but which in process of time will
come into being, or rather into sight. In this, therefore, the
child who is to be tall or short is already tall or short. And
in the resurrection of the body, we need, for the same reason,
fear no bodily loss; for though all should be of equal size,
and reach gigantic proportions, lest the men who were largest
here should lose anything of their bulk and it should perish,
in contradiction to the words of Christ, who said that not a
hair of their head should perish, yet why should there lack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">[Pg 508]</a></span>
the means by which that wonderful Worker should make
such additions, seeing that He is the Creator, who Himself
created all things out of nothing?</p>


<p class="center">15. <i>Whether the bodies of all the dead shall rise the same size as the Lord's
body.</i></p>

<p>It is certain that Christ rose in the same bodily stature in
which He died, and that it is wrong to say that, when the
general resurrection shall have arrived, His body shall, for the
sake of equalling the tallest, assume proportions which it had
not when He appeared to the disciples in the figure with
which they were familiar. But if we say that even the bodies
of taller men are to be reduced to the size of the Lord's body,
there will be a great loss in many bodies, though He promised
that not a hair of their head should perish. It remains,
therefore, that we conclude that every man shall receive his
own size which he had in youth, though he died an old man,
or which he would have had, supposing he died before his
prime. As for what the apostle said of the measure of the
age of the fulness of Christ, we must either understand him
to refer to something else, viz. to the fact that the measure
of Christ will be completed when all the members among the
Christian communities are added to the Head; or if we are
to refer it to the resurrection of the body, the meaning is that
all shall rise neither beyond nor under youth, but in that
vigour and age to which we know that Christ had arrived.
For even the world's wisest men have fixed the bloom of
youth at about the age of thirty; and when this period has
been passed, the man begins to decline towards the defective
and duller period of old age. And therefore the apostle did
not speak of the measure of the body, nor of the measure of
the stature, but of "the measure of the age of the fulness of
Christ."</p>


<p class="center">16. <i>What is meant by the conforming of the saints to the image of the Son of
God.</i></p>

<p>Then, again, these words, "Predestinate to be conformed to
the image of the Son of God,"<a name="FNanchor_990_990" id="FNanchor_990_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990_990" class="fnanchor">[990]</a> may be understood of the
inner man. So in another place He says to us, "Be not conformed
to this world, but be ye transformed in the renewing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
of your mind."<a name="FNanchor_991_991" id="FNanchor_991_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991_991" class="fnanchor">[991]</a> In so far, then, as we are transformed so as
not to be conformed to the world, we are conformed to the
Son of God. It may also be understood thus, that as He
was conformed to us by assuming mortality, we shall be conformed
to Him by immortality; and this indeed is connected
with the resurrection of the body. But if we are also taught
in these words what form our bodies shall rise in, as the measure
we spoke of before, so also this conformity is to be understood
not of size, but of age. Accordingly all shall rise in
the stature they either had attained or would have attained
had they lived to their prime, although it will be no great
disadvantage even if the form of the body be infantine or
aged, while no infirmity shall remain in the mind nor in the
body itself. So that even if any one contends that every person
will rise again in the same bodily form in which he died, we
need not spend much labour in disputing with him.</p>


<p class="center">17. <i>Whether the bodies of women shall retain their own sex in the resurrection.</i></p>

<p>From the words, "Till we all come to a perfect man, to the
measure of the age of the fulness of Christ,"<a name="FNanchor_992_992" id="FNanchor_992_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992_992" class="fnanchor">[992]</a> and from the
words, "Conformed to the image of the Son of God,"<a name="FNanchor_993_993" id="FNanchor_993_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993_993" class="fnanchor">[993]</a> some
conclude that women shall not rise women, but that all shall
be men, because God made man only of earth, and woman of
the man. For my part, they seem to be wiser who make no
doubt that both sexes shall rise. For there shall be no lust,
which is now the cause of confusion. For before they sinned,
the man and the woman were naked, and were not ashamed.
From those bodies, then, vice shall be withdrawn, while nature
shall be preserved. And the sex of woman is not a vice,
but nature. It shall then indeed be superior to carnal intercourse
and child-bearing; nevertheless the female members
shall remain adapted not to the old uses, but to a new beauty,
which, so far from provoking lust, now extinct, shall excite
praise to the wisdom and clemency of God, who both made
what was not and delivered from corruption what He made.
For at the beginning of the human race the woman was made
of a rib taken from the side of the man while he slept; for
it seemed fit that even then Christ and His Church should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">[Pg 510]</a></span>
be foreshadowed in this event. For that sleep of the man
was the death of Christ, whose side, as He hung lifeless upon
the cross, was pierced with a spear, and there flowed from it
blood and water, and these we know to be the sacraments by
which the Church is "built up." For Scripture used this very
word, not saying "He formed" or "framed," but "built her
up into a woman;"<a name="FNanchor_994_994" id="FNanchor_994_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994_994" class="fnanchor">[994]</a> whence also the apostle speaks of the
<i>edification</i> of the body of Christ,<a name="FNanchor_995_995" id="FNanchor_995_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995_995" class="fnanchor">[995]</a> which is the Church. The
woman, therefore, is a creature of God even as the man; but
by her creation from man unity is commended; and the
manner of her creation prefigured, as has been said, Christ and
the Church. He, then, who created both sexes will restore
both. Jesus Himself also, when asked by the Sadducees, who
denied the resurrection, which of the seven brothers should
have to wife the woman whom all in succession had taken to
raise up seed to their brother, as the law enjoined, says, "Ye
do err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God."<a name="FNanchor_996_996" id="FNanchor_996_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996_996" class="fnanchor">[996]</a>
And though it was a fit opportunity for His saying, She
about whom you make inquiries shall herself be a man, and
not a woman, He said nothing of the kind; but "In the
resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage,
but are as the angels of God in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_997_997" id="FNanchor_997_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997_997" class="fnanchor">[997]</a> They shall be
equal to the angels in immortality and happiness, not in flesh,
nor in resurrection, which the angels did not need, because
they could not die. The Lord then denied that there would
be in the resurrection, not women, but marriages; and He
uttered this denial in circumstances in which the question
mooted would have been more easily and speedily solved by
denying that the female sex would exist, if this had in truth
been foreknown by Him. But, indeed, He even affirmed that
the sex should exist by saying, "They shall not be given in
marriage," which can only apply to females; "Neither shall
they marry," which applies to males. There shall therefore
be those who are in this world accustomed to marry and
be given in marriage, only they shall there make no such
marriages.</p>

<p class="center">18. <i>Of the perfect Man, that is, Christ; and of His body, that is, the Church,
which is His fulness.</i></p>

<p>To understand what the apostle means when he says that
we shall all come to a perfect man, we must consider the connection
of the whole passage, which runs thus: "He that descended
is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens,
that He might fill all things. And He gave some, apostles;
and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors
and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of
the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ: till we
all come to the unity of the faith and knowledge of the Son
of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the age of the
fulness of Christ: that we henceforth be no more children,
tossed and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the
sleight of men, and cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait
to deceive; but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up
in Him in all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from
whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by
that which every joint supplieth, according to the effectual
working in the measure of every part, maketh increase of the
body, unto the edifying of itself in love."<a name="FNanchor_998_998" id="FNanchor_998_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998_998" class="fnanchor">[998]</a> Behold what the
perfect man is&mdash;the head and the body, which is made up of
all the members, which in their own time shall be perfected.
But new additions are daily being made to this body while
the Church is being built up, to which it is said, "Ye are the
body of Christ and His members;"<a name="FNanchor_999_999" id="FNanchor_999_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999_999" class="fnanchor">[999]</a> and again, "For His body's
sake," he says, "which is the Church;"<a name="FNanchor_1000_1000" id="FNanchor_1000_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000_1000" class="fnanchor">[1000]</a> and again, "We being
many are one head, one body."<a name="FNanchor_1001_1001" id="FNanchor_1001_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001_1001" class="fnanchor">[1001]</a> It is of the edification of
this body that it is here, too, said, "For the perfecting of the
saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edification of the
body of Christ;" and then that passage of which we are now
speaking is added, "Till we all come to the unity of the faith
and knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the
measure of the age of the fulness of Christ," and so on. And
he shows of what body we are to understand this to be the
measure, when he says, "That we may grow up into Him in
all things, which is the Head, even Christ: from whom the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">[Pg 512]</a></span>
whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which
every joint supplieth, according to the effectual working in the
measure of every part." As, therefore, there is a measure of
every part, so there is a measure of the fulness of the whole
body which is made up of all its parts, and it is of this measure
it is said, "To the measure of the age of the fulness of
Christ." This fulness he spoke of also in the place where he
says of Christ, "And gave Him to be the Head over all things
to the Church,<a name="FNanchor_1002_1002" id="FNanchor_1002_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002_1002" class="fnanchor">[1002]</a> which is His body, the fulness of Him that
filleth all in all."<a name="FNanchor_1003_1003" id="FNanchor_1003_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003_1003" class="fnanchor">[1003]</a> But even if this should be referred to the
form in which each one shall rise, what should hinder us from
applying to the woman what is expressly said of the man,
understanding both sexes to be included under the general
term "man?" For certainly in the saying, "Blessed is he
who feareth the Lord,"<a name="FNanchor_1004_1004" id="FNanchor_1004_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004_1004" class="fnanchor">[1004]</a> women also who fear the Lord are
included.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>19. <i>That all bodily blemishes which mar human beauty in this life shall be removed
in the resurrection, the natural substance of the body remaining,
but the quality and quantity of it being altered so as to produce beauty.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>What am I to say now about the hair and nails? Once it
is understood that no part of the body shall so perish as
to produce deformity in the body, it is at the same time
understood that such things as would have produced a deformity
by their excessive proportions shall be added to the
total bulk of the body, not to parts in which the beauty of
the proportion would thus be marred. Just as if, after making
a vessel of clay, one wished to make it over again of the same
clay, it would not be necessary that the same portion of the
clay which had formed the handle should again form the new
handle, or that what had formed the bottom should again do
so, but only that the whole clay should go to make up the
whole new vessel, and that no part of it should be left unused.
Wherefore, if the hair that has been cropped and the nails
that have been cut would cause a deformity were they to be
restored to their places, they shall not be restored; and yet
no one will lose these parts at the resurrection, for they shall
be changed into the same flesh, their substance being so altered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">[Pg 513]</a></span>
as to preserve the proportion of the various parts of the body.
However, what our Lord said, "Not a hair of your head shall
perish," might more suitably be interpreted of the number,
and not of the length of the hairs, as He elsewhere says, "The
hairs of your head are all numbered."<a name="FNanchor_1005_1005" id="FNanchor_1005_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005_1005" class="fnanchor">[1005]</a> Nor would I say this
because I suppose that any part naturally belonging to the
body can perish, but that whatever deformity was in it, and
served to exhibit the penal condition in which we mortals are,
should be restored in such a way that, while the substance is
entirely preserved, the deformity shall perish. For if even a
human workman, who has, for some reason, made a deformed
statue, can recast it and make it very beautiful, and this without
suffering any part of the substance, but only the deformity
to be lost,&mdash;if he can, for example, remove some unbecoming
or disproportionate part, not by cutting off and separating this
part from the whole, but by so breaking down and mixing up
the whole as to get rid of the blemish without diminishing
the quantity of his material,&mdash;shall we not think as highly of
the almighty Worker? Shall He not be able to remove and
abolish all deformities of the human body, whether common
ones or rare and monstrous, which, though in keeping with
this miserable life, are yet not to be thought of in connection
with that future blessedness; and shall He not be able
so to remove them that, while the natural but unseemly
blemishes are put an end to, the natural substance shall
suffer no diminution?</p>

<p>And consequently overgrown and emaciated persons need
not fear that they shall be in heaven of such a figure as
they would not be even in this world if they could help it.
For all bodily beauty consists in the proportion of the parts,
together with a certain agreeableness of colour. Where there
is no proportion, the eye is offended, either because there is
something awanting, or too small, or too large. And thus
there shall be no deformity resulting from want of proportion
in that state in which all that is wrong is corrected, and all
that is defective supplied from resources the Creator wots of,
and all that is excessive removed without destroying the integrity
of the substance. And as for the pleasant colour, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">[Pg 514]</a></span>
conspicuous shall it be where "the just shall shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of their Father!"<a name="FNanchor_1006_1006" id="FNanchor_1006_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006_1006" class="fnanchor">[1006]</a> This brightness
we must rather believe to have been concealed from the eyes
of the disciples when Christ rose, than to have been awanting.
For weak human eyesight could not bear it, and it was necessary
that they should so look upon Him as to be able to
recognise Him. For this purpose also He allowed them to
touch the marks of His wounds, and also ate and drank,&mdash;not
because He needed nourishment, but because He could take it
if He wished. Now, when an object, though present, is invisible
to persons who see other things which are present, as
we say that that brightness was present but invisible by those
who saw other things, this is called in Greek &#7936;&#959;&#961;&#945;&#963;&#8055;&#945;; and our
Latin translators, for want of a better word, have rendered
this <i>c√¶citas</i> (blindness) in the book of Genesis. This blindness
the men of Sodom suffered when they sought the just
Lot's gate and could not find it. But if it had been blindness,
that is to say, if they could see nothing, then they would not
have asked for the gate by which they might enter the house,
but for guides who might lead them away.</p>

<p>But the love we bear to the blessed martyrs causes us, I
know not how, to desire to see in the heavenly kingdom the
marks of the wounds which they received for the name of
Christ, and possibly we shall see them. For this will not be
a deformity, but a mark of honour, and will add lustre to their
appearance, and a spiritual, if not a bodily beauty. And yet
we need not believe that they to whom it has been said, "Not a
hair of your head shall perish," shall, in the resurrection, want
such of their members as they have been deprived of in their
martyrdom. But if it will be seemly in that new kingdom
to have some marks of these wounds still visible in that immortal
flesh, the places where they have been wounded or mutilated
shall retain the scars without any of the members being
lost. While, therefore, it is quite true that no blemishes
which the body has sustained shall appear in the resurrection,
yet we are not to reckon or name these marks of virtue
blemishes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">[Pg 515]</a></span></p>

<p class="center">20. <i>That, in the resurrection, the substance of our bodies, however disintegrated,
shall be entirely reunited.</i></p>

<p>Far be it from us to fear that the omnipotence of the Creator
cannot, for the resuscitation and reanimation of our bodies,
recall all the portions which have been consumed by beasts or
fire, or have been dissolved into dust or ashes, or have decomposed
into water, or evaporated into the air. Far from us be
the thought, that anything which escapes our observation in any
most hidden recess of nature either evades the knowledge or
transcends the power of the Creator of all things. Cicero, the
great authority of our adversaries, wishing to define God as
accurately as possible, says, "God is a mind free and independent,
without materiality, perceiving and moving all things,
and itself endowed with eternal movement."<a name="FNanchor_1007_1007" id="FNanchor_1007_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007_1007" class="fnanchor">[1007]</a> This he found
in the systems of the greatest philosophers. Let me ask, then,
in their own language, how anything can either lie hid from
Him who perceives all things, or irrevocably escape Him who
moves all things?</p>

<p>This leads me to reply to that question which seems the
most difficult of all,&mdash;To whom, in the resurrection, will belong
the flesh of a dead man which has become the flesh of a living
man? For if some one, famishing for want and pressed with
hunger, use human flesh as food,&mdash;an extremity not unknown,
as both ancient history and the unhappy experience of our own
days have taught us,&mdash;can it be contended, with any show of
reason, that all the flesh eaten has been evacuated, and that
none of it has been assimilated to the substance of the eater,
though the very emaciation which existed before, and has now
disappeared, sufficiently indicates what large deficiencies have
been filled up with this food? But I have already made some
remarks which will suffice for the solution of this difficulty
also. For all the flesh which hunger has consumed finds its
way into the air by evaporation, whence, as we have said, God
Almighty can recall it. That flesh, therefore, shall be restored
to the man in whom it first became human flesh. For it must
be looked upon as borrowed by the other person, and, like a
pecuniary loan, must be returned to the lender. His own
flesh, however, which he lost by famine, shall be restored to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">[Pg 516]</a></span>
him by Him who can recover even what has evaporated. And
though it had been absolutely annihilated, so that no part of
its substance remained in any secret spot of nature, the
Almighty could restore it by such means as He saw fit.
For this sentence, uttered by the Truth, "Not a hair of your
head shall perish," forbids us to suppose that, though no hair
of a man's head can perish, yet the large portions of his flesh
eaten and consumed by the famishing can perish.</p>

<p>From all that we have thus considered, and discussed with
such poor ability as we can command, we gather this conclusion,
that in the resurrection of the flesh the body shall be
of that size which it either had attained or should have
attained in the flower of its youth, and shall enjoy the
beauty that arises from preserving symmetry and proportion
in all its members. And it is reasonable to suppose that, for
the preservation of this beauty, any part of the body's substance,
which, if placed in one spot, would produce a deformity,
shall be distributed through the whole of it, so that neither
any part, nor the symmetry of the whole, may be lost, but
only the general stature of the body somewhat increased by
the distribution in all the parts of that which, in one place,
would have been unsightly. Or if it is contended that each
will rise with the same stature as that of the body he died in,
we shall not obstinately dispute this, provided only there be
no deformity, no infirmity, no languor, no corruption,&mdash;nothing
of any kind which would ill become that kingdom in which the
children of the resurrection and of the promise shall be equal to
the angels of God, if not in body and age, at least in happiness.</p>


<p class="center">21. <i>Of the new spiritual body into which the flesh of the saints shall be
transformed.</i></p>

<p>Whatever, therefore, has been taken from the body, either
during life or after death, shall be restored to it, and, in conjunction
with what has remained in the grave, shall rise
again, transformed from the oldness of the animal body into
the newness of the spiritual body, and clothed in incorruption
and immortality. But even though the body has been all
quite ground to powder by some severe accident, or by the
ruthlessness of enemies, and though it has been so diligently
scattered to the winds, or into the water, that there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">[Pg 517]</a></span>
trace of it left, yet it shall not be beyond the omnipotence of
the Creator,&mdash;no, not a hair of its head shall perish. The
flesh shall then be spiritual, and subject to the spirit, but still
flesh, not spirit, as the spirit itself, when subject to the flesh,
was fleshly, but still spirit and not flesh. And of this we
have experimental proof in the deformity of our penal condition.
For those persons were carnal, not in a fleshly, but in a spiritual
way, to whom the apostle said, "I could not speak to
you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal."<a name="FNanchor_1008_1008" id="FNanchor_1008_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008_1008" class="fnanchor">[1008]</a> And a man is in
this life spiritual in such a way, that he is yet carnal with
respect to his body, and sees another law in his members
warring against the law of his mind; but even in his body
he will be spiritual when the same flesh shall have had that
resurrection of which these words speak, "It is sown an
animal body, it shall rise a spiritual body."<a name="FNanchor_1009_1009" id="FNanchor_1009_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009_1009" class="fnanchor">[1009]</a> But what this
spiritual body shall be, and how great its grace, I fear it were
but rash to pronounce, seeing that we have as yet no experience
of it. Nevertheless, since it is fit that the joyfulness of
our hope should utter itself, and so show forth God's praise,
and since it was from the profoundest sentiment of ardent and
holy love that the Psalmist cried, "O Lord, I have loved the
beauty of Thy house,"<a name="FNanchor_1010_1010" id="FNanchor_1010_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010_1010" class="fnanchor">[1010]</a> we may, with God's help, speak of the
gifts He lavishes on men, good and bad alike, in this most
wretched life, and may do our best to conjecture the great
glory of that state which we cannot worthily speak of, because
we have not yet experienced it. For I say nothing of the
time when God made man upright; I say nothing of the
happy life of "the man and his wife" in the fruitful garden,
since it was so short that none of their children experienced
it: I speak only of this life which we know, and in which we
now are, from the temptations of which we cannot escape so
long as we are in it, no matter what progress we make, for it
is all temptation, and I ask, Who can describe the tokens of
God's goodness that are extended to the human race even in
this life?</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>22. <i>Of the miseries and ills to which the human race is justly exposed through
the first sin, and from which none can be delivered save by Christ's grace.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>That the whole human race has been condemned in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">[Pg 518]</a></span>
first origin, this life itself, if life it is to be called, bears
witness by the host of cruel ills with which it is filled. Is
not this proved by the profound and dreadful ignorance which
produces all the errors that enfold the children of Adam, and
from which no man can be delivered without toil, pain, and
fear? Is it not proved by his love of so many vain and
hurtful things, which produces gnawing cares, disquiet, griefs,
fears, wild joys, quarrels, law-suits, wars, treasons, angers,
hatreds, deceit, flattery, fraud, theft, robbery, perfidy, pride,
ambition, envy, murders, parricides, cruelty, ferocity, wickedness,
luxury, insolence, impudence, shamelessness, fornications,
adulteries, incests, and the numberless uncleannesses and unnatural
acts of both sexes, which it is shameful so much as to
mention; sacrileges, heresies, blasphemies, perjuries, oppression
of the innocent, calumnies, plots, falsehoods, false witnessings,
unrighteous judgments, violent deeds, plunderings, and
whatever similar wickedness has found its way into the lives
of men, though it cannot find its way into the conception of
pure minds? These are indeed the crimes of wicked men, yet
they spring from that root of error and misplaced love which
is born with every son of Adam. For who is there that has
not observed with what profound ignorance, manifesting itself
even in infancy, and with what superfluity of foolish desires,
beginning to appear in boyhood, man comes into this life, so
that, were he left to live as he pleased, and to do whatever he
pleased, he would plunge into all, or certainly into many of
those crimes and iniquities which I mentioned, and could not
mention?</p>

<p>But because God does not wholly desert those whom He
condemns, nor shuts up in His anger His tender mercies, the
human race is restrained by law and instruction, which keep
guard against the ignorance that besets us, and oppose the
assaults of vice, but are themselves full of labour and sorrow.
For what mean those multifarious threats which are used to
restrain the folly of children? What mean pedagogues,
masters, the birch, the strap, the cane, the schooling which
Scripture says must be given a child, "beating him on the
sides lest he wax stubborn,"<a name="FNanchor_1011_1011" id="FNanchor_1011_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011_1011" class="fnanchor">[1011]</a> and it be hardly possible or not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">[Pg 519]</a></span>
possible at all to subdue him? Why all these punishments,
save to overcome ignorance and bridle evil desires&mdash;these
evils with which we come into the world? For why is it that
we remember with difficulty, and without difficulty forget?
learn with difficulty, and without difficulty remain ignorant?
are diligent with difficulty, and without difficulty are indolent?
Does not this show what vitiated nature inclines and
tends to by its own weight, and what succour it needs if it is
to be delivered? Inactivity, sloth, laziness, negligence, are
vices which shun labour, since labour, though useful, is itself
a punishment.</p>

<p>But, besides the punishments of childhood, without which
there would be no learning of what the parents wish,&mdash;and
the parents rarely wish anything useful to be taught,&mdash;who
can describe, who can conceive the number and severity of
the punishments which afflict the human race,&mdash;pains which
are not only the accompaniment of the wickedness of godless
men, but are a part of the human condition and the common
misery,&mdash;what fear and what grief are caused by bereavement
and mourning, by losses and condemnations, by fraud and
falsehood, by false suspicions, and all the crimes and wicked
deeds of other men? For at their hands we suffer robbery,
captivity, chains, imprisonment, exile, torture, mutilation, loss
of sight, the violation of chastity to satisfy the lust of the
oppressor, and many other dreadful evils. What numberless
casualties threaten our bodies from without,&mdash;extremes of
heat and cold, storms, floods, inundations, lightning, thunder,
hail, earthquakes, houses falling; or from the stumbling, or
shying, or vice of horses; from countless poisons in fruits,
water, air, animals; from the painful or even deadly bites of
wild animals; from the madness which a mad dog communicates,
so that even the animal which of all others is most
gentle and friendly to its own master, becomes an object of
intenser fear than a lion or dragon, and the man whom it has
by chance infected with this pestilential contagion becomes so
rabid, that his parents, wife, children, dread him more than
any wild beast! What disasters are suffered by those who
travel by land or sea! What man can go out of his own
house without being exposed on all hands to unforeseen accidents?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">[Pg 520]</a></span>
Returning home sound in limb, he slips on his own
door-step, breaks his leg, and never recovers. What can seem
safer than a man sitting in his chair? Eli the priest fell
from his, and broke his neck. How many accidents do
farmers, or rather all men, fear that the crops may suffer from
the weather, or the soil, or the ravages of destructive animals?
Commonly they feel safe when the crops are gathered and
housed. Yet, to my certain knowledge, sudden floods have
driven the labourers away, and swept the barns clean of the
finest harvest. Is innocence a sufficient protection against the
various assaults of demons? That no man might think so,
even baptized infants, who are certainly unsurpassed in innocence,
are sometimes so tormented, that God, who permits it,
teaches us hereby to bewail the calamities of this life, and to
desire the felicity of the life to come. As to bodily diseases,
they are so numerous that they cannot all be contained even
in medical books. And in very many, or almost all of them,
the cures and remedies are themselves tortures, so that men
are delivered from a pain that destroys by a cure that pains.
Has not the madness of thirst driven men to drink human
urine, and even their own? Has not hunger driven men to
eat human flesh, and that the flesh not of bodies found dead,
but of bodies slain for the purpose? Have not the fierce
pangs of famine driven mothers to eat their own children,
incredibly savage as it seems? In line, sleep itself, which is
justly called repose, how little of repose there sometimes is
in it when disturbed with dreams and visions; and with what
terror is the wretched mind overwhelmed by the appearances of
things which are so presented, and which, as it were, so stand
out before the senses, that we cannot distinguish them from
realities! How wretchedly do false appearances distract men
in certain diseases! With what astonishing variety of appearances
are even healthy men sometimes deceived by evil spirits,
who produce these delusions for the sake of perplexing the
senses of their victims, if they cannot succeed in seducing
them to their side!</p>

<p>From this hell upon earth there is no escape, save through
the grace of the Saviour Christ, our God and Lord. The very
name Jesus shows this, for it means Saviour; and He saves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">[Pg 521]</a></span>
us especially from passing out of this life into a more wretched
and eternal state, which is rather a death than a life. For in
this life, though holy men and holy pursuits afford us great
consolations, yet the blessings which men crave are not invariably
bestowed upon them, lest religion should be cultivated
for the sake of these temporal advantages, while it ought
rather to be cultivated for the sake of that other life from
which all evil is excluded. Therefore, also, does grace aid
good men in the midst of present calamities, so that they are
enabled to endure them with a constancy proportioned to
their faith. The world's sages affirm that philosophy contributes
something to this,&mdash;that philosophy which, according
to Cicero, the gods have bestowed in its purity only on a few
men. They have never given, he says, nor can ever give, a
greater gift to men. So that even those against whom we
are disputing have been compelled to acknowledge, in some
fashion, that the grace of God is necessary for the acquisition,
not, indeed, of any philosophy, but of the true philosophy.
And if the true philosophy&mdash;this sole support against the
miseries of this life&mdash;has been given by Heaven only to a few,
it sufficiently appears from this that the human race has been
condemned to pay this penalty of wretchedness. And as,
according to their acknowledgment, no greater gift has been
bestowed by God, so it must be believed that it could be
given only by that God whom they themselves recognise as
greater than all the gods they worship.</p>


<p class="center">23. <i>Of the miseries of this life which attach peculiarly to the toil of good men,
irrespective of those which are common to the good and bad.</i></p>

<p>But, irrespective of the miseries which in this life are
common to the good and bad, the righteous undergo labours
peculiar to themselves, in so far as they make war upon their
vices, and are involved in the temptations and perils of such
a contest. For though sometimes more violent and at other
times slacker, yet without intermission does the flesh lust
against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh, so that we
cannot do the things we would,<a name="FNanchor_1012_1012" id="FNanchor_1012_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012_1012" class="fnanchor">[1012]</a> and extirpate all lust, but
can only refuse consent to it, as God gives us ability, and so
keep it under, vigilantly keeping watch lest a semblance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">[Pg 522]</a></span>
truth deceive us, lest a subtle discourse blind us, lest error
involve us in darkness, lest we should take good for evil or
evil for good, lest fear should hinder us from doing what we
ought, or desire precipitate us into doing what we ought not,
lest the sun go down upon our wrath, lest hatred provoke us
to render evil for evil, lest unseemly or immoderate grief
consume us, lest an ungrateful disposition make us slow to
recognise benefits received, lest calumnies fret our conscience,
lest rash suspicion on our part deceive us regarding a friend,
or false suspicion of us on the part of others give us too much
uneasiness, lest sin reign in our mortal body to obey its
desires, lest our members be used as the instruments of unrighteousness,
lest the eye follow lust, lest thirst for revenge
carry us away, lest sight or thought dwell too long on some
evil thing which gives us pleasure, lest wicked or indecent
language be willingly listened to, lest we do what is pleasant
but unlawful, and lest in this warfare, filled so abundantly
with toil and peril, we either hope to secure victory by our
own strength, or attribute it when secured to our own strength,
and not to His grace of whom the apostle says, "Thanks be
unto God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus
Christ;"<a name="FNanchor_1013_1013" id="FNanchor_1013_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013_1013" class="fnanchor">[1013]</a> and in another place he says, "In all these things
we are more than conquerors through Him that loved us."<a name="FNanchor_1014_1014" id="FNanchor_1014_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014_1014" class="fnanchor">[1014]</a>
But yet we are to know this, that however valorously we
resist our vices, and however successful we are in overcoming
them, yet as long as we are in this body we have always
reason to say to God, "Forgive us our debts."<a name="FNanchor_1015_1015" id="FNanchor_1015_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015_1015" class="fnanchor">[1015]</a> But in that
kingdom where we shall dwell for ever, clothed in immortal
bodies, we shall no longer have either conflicts or debts,&mdash;as
indeed we should not have had at any time or in any condition,
had our nature continued upright as it was created.
Consequently even this our conflict, in which we are exposed
to peril, and from which we hope to be delivered by a final
victory, belongs to the ills of this life, which is proved by the
witness of so many grave evils to be a life under condemnation.</p>


<p class="center">24. <i>Of the blessings with which the Creator has filled this life, obnoxious
though it be to the curse.</i></p>

<p>But we must now contemplate the rich and countless blessings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">[Pg 523]</a></span>
with which the goodness of God, who cares for all He
has created, has filled this very misery of the human race,
which reflects His retributive justice. That first blessing
which He pronounced before the fall, when He said, "Increase,
and multiply, and replenish the earth,"<a name="FNanchor_1016_1016" id="FNanchor_1016_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016_1016" class="fnanchor">[1016]</a> He did not
inhibit after man had sinned, but the fecundity originally bestowed
remained in the condemned stock; and the vice of sin,
which has involved us in the necessity of dying, has yet not
deprived us of that wonderful power of seed, or rather of that
still more marvellous power by which seed is produced, and
which seems to be as it were inwrought and inwoven in the
human body. But in this river, as I may call it, or torrent
of the human race, both elements are carried along together,&mdash;both
the evil which is derived from him who begets, and the
good which is bestowed by Him who creates us. In the
original evil there are two things, sin and punishment; in the
original good, there are two other things, propagation and
conformation. But of the evils, of which the one, sin, arose
from our audacity, and the other, punishment, from God's
judgment, we have already said as much as suits our present
purpose. I mean now to speak of the blessings which God
has conferred or still confers upon our nature, vitiated and
condemned as it is. For in condemning it He did not withdraw
all that He had given it, else it had been annihilated;
neither did He, in penally subjecting it to the devil, remove
it beyond His own power; for not even the devil himself is
outside of God's government, since the devil's nature subsists
only by the supreme Creator, who gives being to all that in
any form exists.</p>

<p>Of these two blessings, then, which we have said flow from
God's goodness, as from a fountain, towards our nature, vitiated
by sin and condemned to punishment, the one, propagation,
was conferred by God's benediction when He made those first
works, from which He rested on the seventh day. But the
other, conformation, is conferred in that work of His wherein
"He worketh hitherto."<a name="FNanchor_1017_1017" id="FNanchor_1017_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017_1017" class="fnanchor">[1017]</a> For were He to withdraw His efficacious
power from things, they should neither be able to go
on and complete the periods assigned to their measured movements,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">[Pg 524]</a></span>
nor should they even continue in possession of that
nature they were created in. God, then, so created man that
He gave him what we may call fertility, whereby he might
propagate other men, giving them a congenital capacity to
propagate their kind, but not imposing on them any necessity
to do so. This capacity God withdraws at pleasure from individuals,
making them barren; but from the whole race He
has not withdrawn the blessing of propagation once conferred.
But though not withdrawn on account of sin, this power of
propagation is not what it would have been had there been
no sin. For since "man placed in honour fell, he has become
like the beasts,"<a name="FNanchor_1018_1018" id="FNanchor_1018_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018_1018" class="fnanchor">[1018]</a> and generates as they do, though the little
spark of reason, which was the image of God in him, has not
been quite quenched. But if conformation were not added
to propagation, there would be no reproduction of one's kind.
For even though there were no such thing as copulation, and
God wished to fill the earth with human inhabitants, He
might create all these as He created one without the help
of human generation. And, indeed, even as it is, those who
copulate can generate nothing save by the creative energy
of God. As, therefore, in respect of that spiritual growth
whereby a man is formed to piety and righteousness, the
apostle says, "Neither is he that planteth anything, neither
he that watereth, but God that giveth the increase,"<a name="FNanchor_1019_1019" id="FNanchor_1019_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019_1019" class="fnanchor">[1019]</a> so also
it must be said that it is not he that generates that is anything,
but God that giveth the essential form; that it is not
the mother who carries and nurses the fruit of her womb that
is anything, but God that giveth the increase. For He alone,
by that energy wherewith "He worketh hitherto," causes the
seed to develope, and to evolve from certain secret and invisible
folds into the visible forms of beauty which we see.
He alone, coupling and connecting in some wonderful fashion
the spiritual and corporeal natures, the one to command, the
other to obey, makes a living being. And this work of His
is so great and wonderful, that not only man, who is a rational
animal, and consequently more excellent than all other animals
of the earth, but even the most diminutive insect, cannot be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">[Pg 525]</a></span>
considered attentively without astonishment and without praising
the Creator.</p>

<p>It is He, then, who has given to the human soul a mind,
in which reason and understanding lie as it were asleep during
infancy, and as if they were not, destined, however, to be
awakened and exercised as years increase, so as to become
capable of knowledge and of receiving instruction, fit to understand
what is true and to love what is good. It is by this
capacity the soul drinks in wisdom, and becomes endowed
with those virtues by which, in prudence, fortitude, temperance,
and righteousness, it makes war upon error and the
other inborn vices, and conquers them by fixing its desires
upon no other object than the supreme and unchangeable
Good. And even though this be not uniformly the result, yet
who can competently utter or even conceive the grandeur of
this work of the Almighty, and the unspeakable boon He has
conferred upon our rational nature, by giving us even the
capacity of such attainment? For over and above those arts
which are called virtues, and which teach us how we may
spend our life well, and attain to endless happiness,&mdash;arts
which are given to the children of the promise and the kingdom
by the sole grace of God which is in Christ,&mdash;has not
the genius of man invented and applied countless astonishing
arts, partly the result of necessity, partly the result of
exuberant invention, so that this vigour of mind, which is so
active in the discovery not merely of superfluous but even of
dangerous and destructive things, betokens an inexhaustible
wealth in the nature which can invent, learn, or employ such
arts? What wonderful&mdash;one might say stupefying&mdash;advances
has human industry made in the arts of weaving and building,
of agriculture and navigation! With what endless variety
are designs in pottery, painting, and sculpture produced, and
with what skill executed! What wonderful spectacles are
exhibited in the theatres, which those who have not seen
them cannot credit! How skilful the contrivances for catching,
killing, or taming wild beasts! And for the injury of
men, also, how many kinds of poisons, weapons, engines of
destruction, have been invented, while for the preservation or
restoration of health the appliances and remedies are infinite!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">[Pg 526]</a></span>
To provoke appetite and please the palate, what a variety of
seasonings have been concocted! To express and gain entrance
for thoughts, what a multitude and variety of signs there are,
among which speaking and writing hold the first place! what
ornaments has eloquence at command to delight the mind!
what wealth of song is there to captivate the ear! how many
musical instruments and strains of harmony have been devised!
What skill has been attained in measures and
numbers! with what sagacity have the movements and connections
of the stars been discovered! Who could tell the
thought that has been spent upon nature, even though, despairing
of recounting it in detail, he endeavoured only to give
a general view of it? In fine, even the defence of errors and
misapprehensions, which has illustrated the genius of heretics
and philosophers, cannot be sufficiently declared. For at
present it is the nature of the human mind which adorns this
mortal life which we are extolling, and not the faith and the
way of truth which lead to immortality. And since this
great nature has certainly been created by the true and
supreme God, who administers all things He has made with
absolute power and justice, it could never have fallen into
these miseries, nor have gone out of them to miseries eternal,&mdash;saving
only those who are redeemed,&mdash;had not an exceeding
great sin been found in the first man from whom the rest
have sprung.</p>

<p>Moreover, even in the body, though it dies like that of the
beasts, and is in many ways weaker than theirs, what goodness
of God, what providence of the great Creator, is apparent!
The organs of sense and the rest of the members, are not they
so placed, the appearance, and form, and stature of the body
as a whole, is it not so fashioned, as to indicate that it was
made for the service of a reasonable soul? Man has not been
created stooping towards the earth, like the irrational animals;
but his bodily form, erect and looking heavenwards, admonishes
him to mind the things that are above. Then the marvellous
nimbleness which has been given to the tongue and
the hands, fitting them to speak, and write, and execute so
many duties, and practise so many arts, does it not prove the
excellence of the soul for which such an assistant was provided?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">[Pg 527]</a></span>
And even apart from its adaptation to the work
required of it, there is such a symmetry in its various parts,
and so beautiful a proportion maintained, that one is at a loss
to decide whether, in creating the body, greater regard was
paid to utility or to beauty. Assuredly no part of the body
has been created for the sake of utility which does not also
contribute something to its beauty. And this would be all
the more apparent, if we knew more precisely how all its
parts are connected and adapted to one another, and were not
limited in our observations to what appears on the surface;
for as to what is covered up and hidden from our view, the
intricate web of veins and nerves, the vital parts of all that
lies under the skin, no one can discover it. For although,
with a cruel zeal for science, some medical men, who are
called anatomists, have dissected the bodies of the dead, and
sometimes even of sick persons who died under their knives,
and have inhumanly pried into the secrets of the human body
to learn the nature of the disease and its exact seat, and how
it might be cured, yet those relations of which I speak, and
which form the concord,<a name="FNanchor_1020_1020" id="FNanchor_1020_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020_1020" class="fnanchor">[1020]</a> or, as the Greeks call it, "harmony,"
of the whole body outside and in, as of some instrument, no
one has been able to discover, because no one has been audacious
enough to seek for them. But if these could be known,
then even the inward parts, which seem to have no beauty,
would so delight us with their exquisite fitness, as to afford a
profounder satisfaction to the mind&mdash;and the eyes are but its
ministers&mdash;than the obvious beauty which gratifies the eye.
There are some things, too, which have such a place in the
body, that they obviously serve no useful purpose, but are
solely for beauty, as <i>e.g.</i> the teats on a man's breast, or the
beard on his face; for that this is for ornament, and not for
protection, is proved by the bare faces of women, who ought
rather, as the weaker sex, to enjoy such a defence. If, therefore,
of all those members which are exposed to our view,
there is certainly not one in which beauty is sacrificed to
utility, while there are some which serve no purpose but only
beauty, I think it can readily be concluded that in the creation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">[Pg 528]</a></span>
of the human body comeliness was more regarded than
necessity. In truth, necessity is a transitory thing; and the
time is coming when we shall enjoy one another's beauty
without any lust,&mdash;a condition which will specially redound
to the praise of the Creator, who, as it is said in the psalm,
has "put on praise and comeliness."<a name="FNanchor_1021_1021" id="FNanchor_1021_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021_1021" class="fnanchor">[1021]</a></p>

<p>How can I tell of the rest of creation, with all its beauty
and utility, which the divine goodness has given to man to
please his eye and serve his purposes, condemned though he
is, and hurled into these labours and miseries? Shall I speak
of the manifold and various loveliness of sky, and earth, and
sea; of the plentiful supply and wonderful qualities of the
light; of sun, moon, and stars; of the shade of trees; of the
colours and perfume of flowers; of the multitude of birds,
all differing in plumage and in song; of the variety of animals,
of which the smallest in size are often the most wonderful,&mdash;the
works of ants and bees astonishing us more than
the huge bodies of whales? Shall I speak of the sea, which
itself is so grand a spectacle, when it arrays itself as it were
in vestures of various colours, now running through every
shade of green, and again becoming purple or blue? Is it not
delightful to look at it in storm, and experience the soothing
complacency which it inspires, by suggesting that we ourselves
are not tossed and shipwrecked?<a name="FNanchor_1022_1022" id="FNanchor_1022_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022_1022" class="fnanchor">[1022]</a> What shall I say of the
numberless kinds of food to alleviate hunger, and the variety
of seasonings to stimulate appetite which are scattered everywhere
by nature, and for which we are not indebted to the art
of cookery? How many natural appliances are there for preserving
and restoring health! How grateful is the alternation
of day and night! how pleasant the breezes that cool the air!
how abundant the supply of clothing furnished us by trees
and animals! Who can enumerate all the blessings we enjoy?
If I were to attempt to detail and unfold only these few
which I have indicated in the mass, such an enumeration
would fill a volume. And all these are but the solace of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">[Pg 529]</a></span>
wretched and condemned, not the rewards of the blessed.
What then shall these rewards be, if such be the blessings of a
condemned state? What will He give to those whom He has
predestined to life, who has given such things even to those
whom He has predestined to death? What blessings will He
in the blessed life shower upon those for whom, even in this
state of misery, He has been willing that His only-begotten
Son should endure such sufferings even to death? Thus the
apostle reasons concerning those who are predestined to that
kingdom: "He that spared not His own Son, but delivered
Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also give us
all things?"<a name="FNanchor_1023_1023" id="FNanchor_1023_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023_1023" class="fnanchor">[1023]</a> When this promise is fulfilled, what shall we
be? What blessings shall we receive in that kingdom, since
already we have received as the pledge of them Christ's dying?
In what condition shall the spirit of man be, when it has no
longer any vice at all; when it neither yields to any, nor is
in bondage to any, nor has to make war against any, but is
perfected, and enjoys undisturbed peace with itself? Shall
it not then know all things with certainty, and without any
labour or error, when unhindered and joyfully it drinks the
wisdom of God at the fountainhead? What shall the body
be, when it is in every respect subject to the spirit, from
which it shall draw a life so sufficient, as to stand in need of
no other nutriment? For it shall no longer be animal, but
spiritual, having indeed the substance of flesh, but without
any fleshly corruption.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>25. <i>Of the obstinacy of those individuals who impugn the resurrection of the body,
though, as was predicted, the whole world believes it.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The foremost of the philosophers agree with us about the
spiritual felicity enjoyed by the blessed in the life to come;
it is only the resurrection of the flesh they call in question,
and with all their might deny. But the mass of men, learned
and unlearned, the world's wise men and its fools, have believed,
and have left in meagre isolation the unbelievers, and
have turned to Christ, who in His own resurrection demonstrated
the reality of that which seems to our adversaries
absurd. For the world has believed this which God predicted,
as it was also predicted that the world would believe,&mdash;a prediction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">[Pg 530]</a></span>
not due to the sorceries of Peter,<a name="FNanchor_1024_1024" id="FNanchor_1024_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024_1024" class="fnanchor">[1024]</a> since it was uttered
so long before. He who has predicted these things, as I have
already said, and am not ashamed to repeat, is the God before
whom all other divinities tremble, as Porphyry himself owns,
and seeks to prove, by testimonies from the oracles of these
gods, and goes so far as to call Him God the Father and King.
Far be it from us to interpret these predictions as they do who
have not believed, along with the whole world, in that which
it was predicted the world would believe in. For why should
we not rather understand them as the world does, whose
belief was predicted, and leave that handful of unbelievers to
their idle talk and obstinate and solitary infidelity? For if
they maintain that they interpret them differently only to
avoid charging Scripture with folly, and so doing an injury
to that God to whom they bear so notable a testimony, is it
not a much greater injury they do Him when they say that
His predictions must be understood otherwise than the world
believed them, though He Himself praised, promised, accomplished
this belief on the world's part? And why cannot He
cause the body to rise again, and live for ever? or is it not
to be believed that He will do this, because it is an undesirable
thing, and unworthy of God? Of His omnipotence, which
effects so many great miracles, we have already said enough.
If they wish to know what the Almighty cannot do, I shall
tell them He cannot lie. Let us therefore believe what He
can do, by refusing to believe what He cannot do. Refusing
to believe that He can lie, let them believe that He will do
what He has promised to do; and let them believe it as the
world has believed it, whose faith He predicted, whose faith
He praised, whose faith He promised, whose faith He now
points to. But how do they prove that the resurrection is an
undesirable thing? There shall then be no corruption, which
is the only evil thing about the body. I have already said
enough about the order of the elements, and the other fanciful
objections men raise; and in the thirteenth book I have, in
my own judgment, sufficiently illustrated the facility of movement
which the incorruptible body shall enjoy, judging from
the ease and vigour we experience even now, when the body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">[Pg 531]</a></span>
is in good health. Those who have either not read the former
books, or wish to refresh their memory, may read them for
themselves.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>26. <i>That the opinion of Porphyry, that the soul, in order to be blessed, must be
separated from every kind of body, is demolished by Plato, who says that
the supreme God promised the gods that they should never be ousted from
their bodies.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>But, say they, Porphyry tells us that the soul, in order to
be blessed, must escape connection with every kind of body.
It does not avail, therefore, to say that the future body shall
be incorruptible, if the soul cannot be blessed till delivered
from every kind of body. But in the book above mentioned
I have already sufficiently discussed this. This one thing only
will I repeat,&mdash;let Plato, their master, correct his writings, and
say that their gods, in order to be blessed, must quit their
bodies, or, in other words, die; for he said that they were shut
up in celestial bodies, and that, nevertheless, the God who
made them promised them immortality,&mdash;that is to say, an
eternal tenure of these same bodies, such as was not provided
for them naturally, but only by the further intervention of
His will, that thus they might be assured of felicity. In this
he obviously overturns their assertion that the resurrection
of the body cannot be believed because it is impossible; for,
according to him, when the uncreated God promised immortality
to the created gods, He expressly said that He would
do what was impossible. For Plato tells us that He said,
"As ye have had a beginning, so you cannot be immortal
and incorruptible; yet ye shall not decay, nor shall any fate
destroy you or prove stronger than my will, which more effectually
binds you to immortality than the bond of your nature
keeps you from it." If they who hear these words have, we
do not say understanding, but ears, they cannot doubt that
Plato believed that God promised to the gods He had made
that He would effect an impossibility. For He who says,
"Ye cannot be immortal, but by my will ye shall be immortal,"
what else does He say than this, "I shall make you
what ye cannot be?" The body, therefore, shall be raised
incorruptible, immortal, spiritual, by Him who, according to
Plato, has promised to do that which is impossible. Why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">[Pg 532]</a></span>
then do they still exclaim that this which God has promised,
which the world has believed on God's promise as was predicted,
is an impossibility? For what we say is, that the God
who, even according to Plato, does impossible things, will do
this. It is not, then, necessary to the blessedness of the soul
that it be detached from a body of any kind whatever, but
that it receive an incorruptible body. And in what incorruptible
body will they more suitably rejoice than in that in
which they groaned when it was corruptible? For thus they
shall not feel that dire craving which Virgil, in imitation of
Plato, has ascribed to them when he says that they wish to
return again to their bodies.<a name="FNanchor_1025_1025" id="FNanchor_1025_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025_1025" class="fnanchor">[1025]</a> They shall not, I say, feel this
desire to return to their bodies, since they shall have those
bodies to which a return was desired, and shall, indeed, be in
such thorough possession of them, that they shall never lose
them even for the briefest moment, nor ever lay them down
in death.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>27. <i>Of the apparently conflicting opinions of Plato and Porphyry, which would
have conducted them both to the truth if they could have yielded to one
another.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Statements were made by Plato and Porphyry singly, which
if they could have seen their way to hold in common, they
might possibly have become Christians. Plato said that souls
could not exist eternally without bodies; for it was on this
account, he said, that the souls even of wise men must some
time or other return to their bodies. Porphyry, again, said
that the purified soul, when it has returned to the Father, shall
never return to the ills of this world. Consequently, if Plato
had communicated to Porphyry that which he saw to be true,
that souls, though perfectly purified, and belonging to the wise
and righteous, must return to human bodies; and if Porphyry,
again, had imparted to Plato the truth which he saw, that holy
souls shall never return to the miseries of a corruptible body,
so that they should not have each held only his own opinion,
but should both have held both truths, I think they would
have seen that it follows that the souls return to their bodies,
and also that these bodies shall be such as to afford them a
blessed and immortal life. For, according to Plato, even holy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_533" id="Page_533">[Pg 533]</a></span>
souls shall return to the body; according to Porphyry, holy
souls shall not return to the ills of this world. Let Porphyry
then say with Plato, they shall return to the body; let Plato
say with Porphyry, they shall not return to their old misery:
and they will agree that they return to bodies in which they
shall suffer no more. And this is nothing else than what God
has promised,&mdash;that He will give eternal felicity to souls joined
to their own bodies. For this, I presume, both of them would
readily concede, that if the souls of the saints are to be reunited
to bodies, it shall be to their own bodies, in which they
have endured the miseries of this life, and in which, to escape
these miseries, they served God with piety and fidelity.</p>


<blockquote style="text-indent:-2em">

<p>28. <i>What Plato or Labeo, or even Varro, might have contributed to the true
faith of the resurrection, if they had adopted one another's opinions into
one scheme.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Some Christians, who have a liking for Plato on account of
his magnificent style and the truths which he now and then
uttered, say that he even held an opinion similar to our own
regarding the resurrection of the dead. Cicero, however, alluding
to this in his <i>Republic</i>, asserts that Plato meant it rather
as a playful fancy than as a reality; for he introduces a man<a name="FNanchor_1026_1026" id="FNanchor_1026_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026_1026" class="fnanchor">[1026]</a>
who had come to life again, and gave a narrative of his experience
in corroboration of the doctrines of Plato. Labeo, too,
says that two men died on one day, and met at a cross-road,
and that, being afterwards ordered to return to their bodies,
they agreed to be friends for life, and were so till they died
again. But the resurrection which these writers instance resembles
that of those persons whom we have ourselves known
to rise again, and who came back indeed to this life, but not
so as never to die again. Marcus Varro, however, in his work
<i>On the Origin of the Roman People</i>, records something more
remarkable; I think his own words should be given. "Certain
astrologers," he says, "have written that men are destined to
a new birth, which the Greeks call <i>palingenesy</i>. This will take
place after four hundred and forty years have elapsed; and then
the same soul and the same body, which were formerly united
in the person, shall again be reunited." This Varro, indeed, or
those nameless astrologers,&mdash;for he does not give us the names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">[Pg 534]</a></span>
of the men whose statement he cites,&mdash;have affirmed what is
indeed not altogether true; for once the souls have returned to
the bodies they wore, they shall never afterwards leave them.
Yet what they say upsets and demolishes much of that idle
talk of our adversaries about the impossibility of the resurrection.
For those who have been or are of this opinion, have
not thought it possible that bodies which have dissolved into
air, or dust, or ashes, or water, or into the bodies of the beasts
or even of the men that fed on them, should be restored again
to that which they formerly were. And therefore, if Plato
and Porphyry, or rather, if their disciples now living, agree
with us that holy souls shall return to the body, as Plato says,
and that, nevertheless, they shall not return to misery, as Porphyry
maintains,&mdash;if they accept the consequence of these two
propositions which is taught by the Christian faith, that they
shall receive bodies in which they may live eternally without
suffering any misery,&mdash;let them also adopt from Varro the
opinion that they shall return to the same bodies as they were
formerly in, and thus the whole question of the eternal resurrection
of the body shall be resolved out of their own mouths.</p>


<p class="center">29. <i>Of the beatific vision.</i></p>

<p>And now let us consider, with such ability as God may
vouchsafe, how the saints shall be employed when they are
clothed in immortal and spiritual bodies, and when the flesh
shall live no longer in a fleshly but a spiritual fashion. And
indeed, to tell the truth, I am at a loss to understand the
nature of that employment, or, shall I rather say, repose and
ease, for it has never come within the range of my bodily
senses. And if I should speak of my mind or understanding,
what is our understanding in comparison of its excellence?
For then shall be that "peace of God which," as the apostle
says, "passeth all understanding,"<a name="FNanchor_1027_1027" id="FNanchor_1027_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027_1027" class="fnanchor">[1027]</a>&mdash;that is to say, all human,
and perhaps all angelic understanding, but certainly not the
divine. That it passeth ours there is no doubt; but if it
passeth that of the angels,&mdash;and he who says "<i>all</i> understanding"
seems to make no exception in their favour,&mdash;then we
must understand him to mean that neither we nor the angels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">[Pg 535]</a></span>
can understand, as God understands, the peace which God Himself
enjoys. Doubtless this passeth all understanding but His
own. But as we shall one day be made to participate, according
to our slender capacity, in His peace, both in ourselves,
and with our neighbour, and with God our chief good, in this
respect the angels understand the peace of God in their own
measure, and men too, though now far behind them, whatever
spiritual advance they have made. For we must remember
how great a man he was who said, "We know in part, and
we prophesy in part, until that which is perfect is come;"<a name="FNanchor_1028_1028" id="FNanchor_1028_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028_1028" class="fnanchor">[1028]</a>
and "Now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to
face."<a name="FNanchor_1029_1029" id="FNanchor_1029_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029_1029" class="fnanchor">[1029]</a> Such also is now the vision of the holy angels, who
are also called our angels, because we, being rescued out of
the power of darkness, and receiving the earnest of the Spirit,
are translated into the kingdom of Christ, and already begin
to belong to those angels with whom we shall enjoy that holy
and most delightful city of God of which we have now written
so much. Thus, then, the angels of God are our angels, as
Christ is God's and also ours. They are God's, because they
have not abandoned Him; they are ours, because we are their
fellow-citizens. The Lord Jesus also said, "See that ye despise
not one of these little ones: for I say unto you, That in
heaven their angels do always see the face of my Father which
is in heaven."<a name="FNanchor_1030_1030" id="FNanchor_1030_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030_1030" class="fnanchor">[1030]</a> As, then, they see, so shall we also see; but
not yet do we thus see. Wherefore the apostle uses the words
cited a little ago, "Now we see through a glass, darkly; but
then face to face." This vision is reserved as the reward of
our faith; and of it the Apostle John also says, "When He
shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He
is."<a name="FNanchor_1031_1031" id="FNanchor_1031_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031_1031" class="fnanchor">[1031]</a> By "the face" of God we are to understand His manifestation,
and not a part of the body similar to that which in
our bodies we call by that name.</p>

<p>And so, when I am asked how the saints shall be employed
in that spiritual body, I do not say what I see, but I say what
I believe, according to that which I read in the psalm, "I believed,
therefore have I spoken."<a name="FNanchor_1032_1032" id="FNanchor_1032_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032_1032" class="fnanchor">[1032]</a> I say, then, they shall in
the body see God; but whether they shall see Him by means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">[Pg 536]</a></span>
of the body, as now we see the sun, moon, stars, sea, earth,
and all that is in it, that is a difficult question. For it is
hard to say that the saints shall then have such bodies that
they shall not be able to shut and open their eyes as they
please; while it is harder still to say that every one who shuts
his eyes shall lose the vision of God. For if the prophet
Elisha, though at a distance, saw his servant Gehazi, who
thought that his wickedness would escape his master's observation
and accepted gifts from Naaman the Syrian, whom the
prophet had cleansed from his foul leprosy, how much more
shall the saints in the spiritual body see all things, not only
though their eyes be shut, but though they themselves be at
a great distance? For then shall be "that which is perfect,"
of which the apostle says, "We know in part, and we prophesy
in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then
that which is in part shall be done away." Then, that he
may illustrate as well as possible, by a simile, how superior
the future life is to the life now lived, not only by ordinary
men, but even by the foremost of the saints, he says,
"When I was a child, I understood as a child, I spake as a
child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put
away childish things. Now we see through a glass, darkly;
but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall
I know even as also I am known."<a name="FNanchor_1033_1033" id="FNanchor_1033_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033_1033" class="fnanchor">[1033]</a> If, then, even in this
life, in which the prophetic power of remarkable men is no
more worthy to be compared to the vision of the future life
than childhood is to manhood, Elisha, though distant from his
servant, saw him accepting gifts, shall we say that when that
which is perfect is come, and the corruptible body no longer
oppresses the soul, but is incorruptible and offers no impediment
to it, the saints shall need bodily eyes to see, though
Elisha had no need of them to see his servant? For, following
the Septuagint version, these are the prophet's words: "Did not
my heart go with thee, when the man came out of his chariot
to meet thee, and thou tookedst his gifts?"<a name="FNanchor_1034_1034" id="FNanchor_1034_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034_1034" class="fnanchor">[1034]</a> Or, as the presbyter
Jerome rendered it from the Hebrew, "Was not my heart
present when the man turned from his chariot to meet thee?"
The prophet said that he saw this with his heart, miraculously<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">[Pg 537]</a></span>
aided by God, as no one can doubt. But how much more
abundantly shall the saints enjoy this gift when God shall be
all in all? Nevertheless the bodily eyes also shall have their
office and their place, and shall be used by the spirit through
the spiritual body. For the prophet did not forego the use of
his eyes for seeing what was before them, though he did not
need them to see his absent servant, and though he could have
seen these present objects in spirit, and with his eyes shut, as
he saw things far distant in a place where he himself was not.
Far be it, then, from us to say that in the life to come the
saints shall not see God when their eyes are shut, since they
shall always see Him with the spirit.</p>

<p>But the question arises, whether, when their eyes are open,
they shall see Him with the bodily eye? If the eyes of the
spiritual body have no more power than the eyes which we
now possess, manifestly God cannot be seen with them. They
must be of a very different power if they can look upon that
incorporeal nature which is not contained in any place, but is
all in every place. For though we say that God is in heaven
and on earth, as He Himself says by the prophet, "I fill
heaven and earth,"<a name="FNanchor_1035_1035" id="FNanchor_1035_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035_1035" class="fnanchor">[1035]</a> we do not mean that there is one part of
God in heaven and another part on earth; but He is all in
heaven and all on earth, not at alternate intervals of time,
but both at once, as no bodily nature can be. The eye, then,
shall have a vastly superior power,&mdash;the power not of keen
sight, such as is ascribed to serpents or eagles, for however
keenly these animals see, they can discern nothing but bodily
substances,&mdash;but the power of seeing things incorporeal. Possibly
it was this great power of vision which was temporarily
communicated to the eyes of the holy Job while yet in this
mortal body, when he says to God, "I have heard of Thee by
the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth Thee: wherefore
I abhor myself, and melt away, and count myself dust
and ashes;"<a name="FNanchor_1036_1036" id="FNanchor_1036_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036_1036" class="fnanchor">[1036]</a> although there is no reason why we should not
understand this of the eye of the heart, of which the apostle
says, "Having the eyes of your heart illuminated."<a name="FNanchor_1037_1037" id="FNanchor_1037_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037_1037" class="fnanchor">[1037]</a> But that
God shall be seen with these eyes no Christian doubts who
believingly accepts what our God and Master says, "Blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">[Pg 538]</a></span>
are the pure in heart: for they shall see God."<a name="FNanchor_1038_1038" id="FNanchor_1038_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038_1038" class="fnanchor">[1038]</a> But whether
in the future life God shall also be seen with the bodily eye,
this is now our question.</p>

<p>The expression of Scripture, "And all flesh shall see the
salvation of God,"<a name="FNanchor_1039_1039" id="FNanchor_1039_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039_1039" class="fnanchor">[1039]</a> may without difficulty be understood as
if it were said, "And every man shall see the Christ of God."
And He certainly was seen in the body, and shall be seen in
the body when He judges quick and dead. And that Christ
is the salvation of God, many other passages of Scripture witness,
but especially the words of the venerable Simeon, who,
when he had received into his hands the infant Christ, said,
"Now lettest Thou Thy servant depart in peace, according to
Thy word: for mine eyes have seen Thy salvation."<a name="FNanchor_1040_1040" id="FNanchor_1040_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040_1040" class="fnanchor">[1040]</a> As for
the words of the above-mentioned Job, as they are found in
the Hebrew manuscripts, "And in my flesh I shall see God,"<a name="FNanchor_1041_1041" id="FNanchor_1041_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041_1041" class="fnanchor">[1041]</a>
no doubt they were a prophecy of the resurrection of the
flesh; yet he does not say "<i>by</i> the flesh." And indeed, if he
had said this, it would still be possible that Christ was meant
by "God;" for Christ shall be seen by the flesh in the flesh.
But even understanding it of God, it is only equivalent to
saying, I shall be in the flesh when I see God. Then the
apostle's expression, "face to face,"<a name="FNanchor_1042_1042" id="FNanchor_1042_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042_1042" class="fnanchor">[1042]</a> does not oblige us to
believe that we shall see God by the bodily face in which are
the eyes of the body, for we shall see Him without intermission
in spirit. And if the apostle had not referred to the
face of the inner man, he would not have said, "But we, with
unveiled face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord,
are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as
by the Spirit of the Lord."<a name="FNanchor_1043_1043" id="FNanchor_1043_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043_1043" class="fnanchor">[1043]</a> In the same sense we understand
what the Psalmist sings, "Draw near unto Him, and be
enlightened; and your faces shall not be ashamed."<a name="FNanchor_1044_1044" id="FNanchor_1044_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044_1044" class="fnanchor">[1044]</a> For it is
by faith we draw near to God, and faith is an act of the spirit,
not of the body. But as we do not know what degree of perfection
the spiritual body shall attain,&mdash;for here we speak of a
matter of which we have no experience, and upon which the
authority of Scripture does not definitely pronounce,&mdash;it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">[Pg 539]</a></span>
necessary that the words of the Book of Wisdom be illustrated
in us: "The thoughts of mortal men are timid, and our forecastings
uncertain."<a name="FNanchor_1045_1045" id="FNanchor_1045_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045_1045" class="fnanchor">[1045]</a></p>

<p>For if that reasoning of the philosophers, by which they
attempt to make out that intelligible or mental objects are so
seen by the mind, and sensible or bodily objects so seen by the
body, that the former cannot be discerned by the mind through
the body, nor the latter by the mind itself without the body,&mdash;if
this reasoning were trustworthy, then it would certainly
follow that God could not be seen by the eye even of a
spiritual body. But this reasoning is exploded both by true
reason and by prophetic authority. For who is so little acquainted
with the truth as to say that God has no cognisance
of sensible objects? Has He therefore a body, the eyes
of which give Him this knowledge? Moreover, what we
have just been relating of the prophet Elisha, does this not
sufficiently show that bodily things can be discerned by the
spirit without the help of the body? For when that servant
received the gifts, certainly this was a bodily or material
transaction, yet the prophet saw it not by the body, but by
the spirit. As, therefore, it is agreed that bodies are seen by
the spirit, what if the power of the spiritual body shall be so
great that spirit also is seen by the body? For God is a
spirit. Besides, each man recognises his own life&mdash;that life
by which he now lives in the body, and which vivifies these
earthly members and causes them to grow&mdash;by an interior
sense, and not by his bodily eye; but the life of other men,
though it is invisible, he sees with the bodily eye. For how do
we distinguish between living and dead bodies, except by seeing
at once both the body and the life which we cannot see save
by the eye? But a life without a body we cannot see thus.</p>

<p>Wherefore it may very well be, and it is thoroughly credible,
that we shall in the future world see the material forms
of the new heavens and the new earth in such a way that we
shall most distinctly recognise God everywhere present and
governing all things, material as well as spiritual, and shall
see Him, not as now we understand the invisible things of
God, by the things which are made,<a name="FNanchor_1046_1046" id="FNanchor_1046_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046_1046" class="fnanchor">[1046]</a> and see Him darkly, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">[Pg 540]</a></span>
in a mirror, and in part, and rather by faith than by bodily
vision of material appearances, but by means of the bodies we
shall wear and which we shall see wherever we turn our eyes.
As we do not believe, but see that the living men around us
who are exercising vital functions are alive, though we cannot
see their life without their bodies, but see it most distinctly by
means of their bodies, so, wherever we shall look with those
spiritual eyes of our future bodies, we shall then, too, by
means of bodily substances behold God, though a spirit, ruling
all things. Either, therefore, the eyes shall possess some
quality similar to that of the mind, by which they may be
able to discern spiritual things, and among these God,&mdash;a
supposition for which it is difficult or even impossible to find
any support in Scripture,&mdash;or, which is more easy to comprehend,
God will be so known by us, and shall be so much before
us, that we shall see Him by the spirit in ourselves, in one
another, in Himself, in the new heavens and the new earth, in
every created thing which shall then exist; and also by the
body we shall see Him in every body which the keen vision
of the eye of the spiritual body shall reach. Our thoughts
also shall be visible to all, for then shall be fulfilled the words
of the apostle, "Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord
come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness,
and will make manifest the thoughts of the heart, and
then shall every one have praise of God."<a name="FNanchor_1047_1047" id="FNanchor_1047_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047_1047" class="fnanchor">[1047]</a></p>


<p class="center">30. <i>Of the eternal felicity of the city of God, and of the perpetual Sabbath.</i></p>

<p>How great shall be that felicity, which shall be tainted with
no evil, which shall lack no good, and which shall afford
leisure for the praises of God, who shall be all in all! For I
know not what other employment there can be where no lassitude
shall slacken activity, nor any want stimulate to labour.
I am admonished also by the sacred song, in which I read or
hear the words, "Blessed are they that dwell in Thy house,
O Lord; they will be still praising Thee."<a name="FNanchor_1048_1048" id="FNanchor_1048_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048_1048" class="fnanchor">[1048]</a> All the members
and organs of the incorruptible body, which now we see to be
suited to various necessary uses, shall contribute to the praises
of God; for in that life necessity shall have no place, but full,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">[Pg 541]</a></span>
certain, secure, everlasting felicity. For all those parts<a name="FNanchor_1049_1049" id="FNanchor_1049_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049_1049" class="fnanchor">[1049]</a> of the
bodily harmony, which are distributed through the whole body,
within and without, and of which I have just been saying
that they at present elude our observation, shall then be discerned;
and, along with the other great and marvellous discoveries
which shall then kindle rational minds in praise of
the great Artificer, there shall be the enjoyment of a beauty
which appeals to the reason. What power of movement such
bodies shall possess, I have not the audacity rashly to define,
as I have not the ability to conceive. Nevertheless I will say
that in any case, both in motion and at rest, they shall be,
as in their appearance, seemly; for into that state nothing
which is unseemly shall be admitted. One thing is certain,
the body shall forthwith be wherever the spirit wills, and the
spirit shall will nothing which is unbecoming either to the
spirit or to the body. True honour shall be there, for it shall
be denied to none who is worthy, nor yielded to any unworthy;
neither shall any unworthy person so much as sue for it, for
none but the worthy shall be there. True peace shall be
there, where no one shall suffer opposition either from himself
or any other. God Himself, who is the Author of virtue,
shall there be its reward; for, as there is nothing greater or
better, He has promised Himself. What else was meant by
His word through the prophet, "I will be your God, and ye
shall be my people,"<a name="FNanchor_1050_1050" id="FNanchor_1050_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050_1050" class="fnanchor">[1050]</a> than, I shall be their satisfaction, I shall
be all that men honourably desire,&mdash;life, and health, and nourishment,
and plenty, and glory, and honour, and peace, and all
good things? This, too, is the right interpretation of the saying
of the apostle, "That God may be all in all."<a name="FNanchor_1051_1051" id="FNanchor_1051_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051_1051" class="fnanchor">[1051]</a> He shall be
the end of our desires who shall be seen without end, loved
without cloy, praised without weariness. This outgoing of
affection, this employment, shall certainly be, like eternal life
itself, common to all.</p>

<p>But who can conceive, not to say describe, what degrees of
honour and glory shall be awarded to the various degrees of
merit? Yet it cannot be doubted that there shall be degrees.
And in that blessed city there shall be this great blessing, that
no inferior shall envy any superior, as now the archangels are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">[Pg 542]</a></span>
not envied by the angels, because no one will wish to be what
he has not received, though bound in strictest concord with
him who has received; as in the body the finger does not seek
to be the eye, though both members are harmoniously included
in the complete structure of the body. And thus, along with
his gift, greater or less, each shall receive this further gift of
contentment to desire no more than he has.</p>

<p>Neither are we to suppose that because sin shall have no
power to delight them, free will must be withdrawn. It will,
on the contrary, be all the more truly free, because set free
from delight in sinning to take unfailing delight in not sinning.
For the first freedom of will which man received when he was
created upright consisted in an ability not to sin, but also in
an ability to sin; whereas this last freedom of will shall be
superior, inasmuch as it shall not be able to sin. This, indeed,
shall not be a natural ability, but the gift of God. For it is
one thing to be God, another thing to be a partaker of God.
God by nature cannot sin, but the partaker of God receives
this inability from God. And in this divine gift there was to
be observed this gradation, that man should first receive a free
will by which he was able not to sin, and at last a free will by
which he was not able to sin,&mdash;the former being adapted to the
acquiring of merit, the latter to the enjoying of the reward.<a name="FNanchor_1052_1052" id="FNanchor_1052_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052_1052" class="fnanchor">[1052]</a>
But the nature thus constituted, having sinned when it had
the ability to do so, it is by a more abundant grace that it is
delivered so as to reach that freedom in which it cannot sin.
For as the first immortality which Adam lost by sinning consisted
in his being able not to die, while the last shall consist
in his not being able to die; so the first free will consisted in
his being able not to sin, the last in his not being able to sin.
And thus piety and justice shall be as indefeasible as happiness.
For certainly by sinning we lost both piety and happiness;
but when we lost happiness, we did not lose the love of
it. Are we to say that God Himself is not free because He
cannot sin? In that city, then, there shall be free will, one
in all the citizens, and indivisible in each, delivered from all
ill, Filled with all good, enjoying indefeasibly the delights of
eternal joys, oblivious of sins, oblivious of sufferings, and yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">[Pg 543]</a></span>
not so oblivious of its deliverance as to be ungrateful to its
Deliverer.</p>

<p>The soul, then, shall have an intellectual remembrance of its
past ills; but, so far as regards sensible experience, they shall
be quite forgotten. For a skilful physician knows, indeed, professionally
almost all diseases; but experimentally he is ignorant
of a great number which he himself has never suffered
from. As, therefore, there are two ways of knowing evil
things,&mdash;one by mental insight, the other by sensible experience,
for it is one thing to understand all vices by the wisdom of a
cultivated mind, another to understand them by the foolishness
of an abandoned life,&mdash;so also there are two ways of forgetting
evils. For a well-instructed and learned man forgets them one
way, and he who has experimentally suffered from them forgets
them another,&mdash;the former by neglecting what he has learned,
the latter by escaping what he has suffered. And in this
latter way the saints shall forget their past ills, for they shall
have so thoroughly escaped them all, that they shall be quite
blotted out of their experience. But their intellectual knowledge,
which shall be great, shall keep them acquainted not
only with their own past woes, but with the eternal sufferings
of the lost. For if they were not to know that they had been
miserable, how could they, as the Psalmist says, for ever sing
the mercies of God? Certainly that city shall have no greater
joy than the celebration of the grace of Christ, who redeemed
us by His blood. There shall be accomplished the words of
the psalm, "Be still, and know that I am God."<a name="FNanchor_1053_1053" id="FNanchor_1053_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053_1053" class="fnanchor">[1053]</a> There shall
be the great Sabbath which has no evening, which God celebrated
among His first works, as it is written, "And God
rested on the seventh day from all His works which He had
made. And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it;
because that in it He had rested from all His work which God
began to make."<a name="FNanchor_1054_1054" id="FNanchor_1054_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054_1054" class="fnanchor">[1054]</a> For we shall ourselves be the seventh day,
when we shall be filled and replenished with God's blessing
and sanctification. There shall we be still, and know that He
is God; that He is that which we ourselves aspired to be
when we fell away from Him, and listened to the voice of the
seducer, "Ye shall be as gods,"<a name="FNanchor_1055_1055" id="FNanchor_1055_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055_1055" class="fnanchor">[1055]</a> and so abandoned God, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">[Pg 544]</a></span>
would have made us as gods, not by deserting Him, but by
participating in Him. For without Him what have we accomplished,
save to perish in His anger? But when we are
restored by Him, and perfected with greater grace, we shall
have eternal leisure to see that He is God, for we shall be full
of Him when He shall be all in all. For even our good works,
when they are understood to be rather His than ours, are
imputed to us that we may enjoy this Sabbath rest. For
if we attribute them to ourselves, they shall be servile; for
it is said of the Sabbath, "Ye shall do no servile work in
it."<a name="FNanchor_1056_1056" id="FNanchor_1056_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056_1056" class="fnanchor">[1056]</a> Wherefore also it is said by Ezekiel the prophet, "And
I gave them my Sabbaths to be a sign between me and them,
that they might know that I am the Lord who sanctify them."<a name="FNanchor_1057_1057" id="FNanchor_1057_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057_1057" class="fnanchor">[1057]</a>
This knowledge shall be perfected when we shall be perfectly
at rest, and shall perfectly know that He is God.</p>

<p>This Sabbath shall appear still more clearly if we count the
ages as days, in accordance with the periods of time defined
in Scripture, for that period will be found to be the seventh.
The first age, as the first day, extends from Adam to the
deluge; the second from the deluge to Abraham, equalling the
first, not in length of time, but in the number of generations,
there being ten in each. From Abraham to the advent of
Christ there are, as the evangelist Matthew calculates, three
periods, in each of which are fourteen generations,&mdash;one period
from Abraham to David, a second from David to the captivity,
a third from the captivity to the birth of Christ in the flesh.
There are thus five ages in all. The sixth is now passing, and
cannot be measured by any number of generations, as it has
been said, "It is not for you to know the times, which the
Father hath put in His own power."<a name="FNanchor_1058_1058" id="FNanchor_1058_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058_1058" class="fnanchor">[1058]</a> After this period God
shall rest as on the seventh day, when He shall give us (who
shall be the seventh day) rest in Himself. But there is not now
space to treat of these ages; suffice it to say that the seventh
shall be our Sabbath, which shall be brought to a close, not
by an evening, but by the Lord's day, as an eighth and eternal
day, consecrated by the resurrection of Christ, and prefiguring
the eternal repose not only of the spirit, but also of the body.
There we shall rest and see, see and love, love and praise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">[Pg 545]</a></span>
This is what shall be in the end without end. For what other
end do we propose to ourselves than to attain to the kingdom
of which there is no end?</p>

<p>I think I have now, by God's help, discharged my obligation
in writing this large work. Let those who think I have said
too little, or those who think I have said too much, forgive
me; and let those who think I have said just enough join me
in giving thanks to God. Amen.</p>

<h5>EDITED BY THE</h5>

<h3><b>REV. ALEXANDER ROBERTS, D.D.</b>,</h3>

<h4>Rector of the Royal High School, Edinburgh, and Author of

<p>Messrs. Clark are now happy to announce the near completion of this
Series. It has been received with marked approval by all sections of the
Christian Church in this country and in the United States, as supplying what
has long been felt to be a want, and also on account of the impartiality, learning,
and care with which Editors and Translators have executed a very difficult
task.</p>

<p>The whole Series will be completed in Twenty-four Volumes, of which
Eighteen are ready, and the remaining Six will be published in the course of
this year.</p>

<p>Each Work is supplied with a good and full Index; but, to add to the value
of the completed Series, an Index Volume is preparing for the whole Series,
which will be sold separately to those who may desire it, at a moderate price;
and the complete Series (exclusive of General Index), in Twenty-four Volumes,
will cost Six Guineas.</p>

<p>The Subscription for 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th Years is now due&mdash;¬£5, 5s.</p>

<blockquote style="text-indent:-1em">

<p><i>The Subscription to the Series is at the rate of</i> 21<i>s. for Four Volumes when paid
in advance</i> (<i>or</i> 24<i>s. when not so paid</i>), <i>and</i> 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d. each Volume to Non-Subscribers.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The Publishers, however, do not bind themselves to <i>continue</i> to supply the
complete Series at this rate.</p>

<p>Single Years cannot be had separately, with the exception of current year,

and to deter. "No one punishes an offender on account of the past offence,
and simply because he has done wrong, but for the sake of the future, that the
offence may not be again committed, either by the same person or by any one
who has seen him punished."&mdash;See the <i>Protagoras</i>, 324, b, and Grote's <i>Plato</i>,

<i>Confessions</i>, ix. 16. See also <i>Serm.</i> 286, and Ambrose, <i>Ep.</i>. 22. A translation
of this epistle in full is given in Isaac Taylor's <i>Ancient Christianity</i>, ii. 242,
where this miracle is taken as a specimen of the so-called miracles of that age,
and submitted to a detailed examination. The result arrived at will be gathered
from the following sentence: "In the Nicene Church, so lax were the notions
of common morality, and in so feeble a manner did the fear of God influence the
conduct of leading men, that, on occasions when the Church was to be served,
and her assailants to be confounded, they did not scruple to take upon themselves
the contrivance and execution of the most degrading impostures."&mdash;P. 270.
It is to be observed, however, that Augustine was, at least in this instance, one
of the deceived.</p></div>
